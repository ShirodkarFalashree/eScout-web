Yoga brings the body and mind together and is built on three main elements – movement, breathing and meditation. Yoga has many physical and mental health benefits including improved posture, flexibility, strength, balance and body awareness.
Always consult your doctor before embarking on any new fitness program, especially if you have a pre-existing medical condition or have not exercised in a long time.
Pilates and yoga are often thought to be one in the same, however Pilates traditionally focuses more on control of movement and muscular endurance as opposed to yoga which connects the body to the mind through flow of movement.
Yoga is an ancient Indian philosophy that dates back thousands of years. It was designed as a path to spiritual enlightenment, but in modern times, the physical aspects of yoga have found huge popularity as a gentle form of exercise and stress management. There are many different varieties of yoga, but each one essentially relies on structured poses (asanas) practiced with breath awareness.
Researchers have discovered that the regular practice of yoga may produce many health benefits, including increased cardiovascular fitness, improved muscular strength and normalisation of blood pressure. Yoga is a renowned antidote to stress and promotes improved sleeping patterns. Over time, those who practice yoga report lower levels of stress, and increased feelings of happiness and wellbeing. This is because concentrating on the postures and the breath acts as a form of meditation.
The classical techniques of yoga date back more than 5000 years. The practice of yoga encourages effort, intelligence, accuracy, thoroughness, commitment and dedication. The word yoga originates from the Sanskrit language and means ‘to join or yoke together’. It brings your body and mind together, and is built on three main elements – exercise, breathing and meditation.
The movements of yoga are designed to  challenge flexibility, balance, coordination and strength, increasing your body’s efficiency and overall health. Breathing techniques promote greater mind body connection, improving the  function of body and mind.
Focusing on controlled movement and breathing prepares the body and mind for meditation, with an approach to a quiet mind that allows silence and relief from everyday stress. When practiced regularly, yoga can become a powerful and sophisticated discipline for achieving physical, mental and emotional wellbeing.
There are many different varieties of yoga, each with a slightly different slant. The most popular are Hatha, Bikram, Iyengar, Yin and Vinyasa yoga.
Each yoga posture, or asana, is held for a period of time and linked with controlled breathing. Generally, a yoga session begins with gentle asanas and works up to more vigorous or challenging postures. A full yoga session should move every part of your body and should include pranayama (breath control practices), relaxation and meditation.
The different postures or asanas include:
The practice of yoga asanas develops strength and flexibility, while soothing your nerves and calming your mind. The asanas affect the muscles, joints and skin, and the whole body – glands, nerves, internal organs, bones, respiration and the brain. The physical building blocks of yoga are the posture and the breath.
Health benefits of yoga include:
Yoga is taught in classes, catering for beginners through to advanced participants. It is non-competitive and suitable for anyone, regardless of your age or fitness level. Your yoga teacher should carefully guide and observe you, and modify postures when necessary.
An asana should never cause pain. If you experience pain or discomfort, ease back on the stretch or don’t do it at all. It is important to keep within your physical limits.
If you are a male over 45 years of age or a female over 55 years of age, haven’t exercised for a long time or have a pre-existing medical condition, you should check with your preferred general practitioner or another suitably qualified professional before starting any new or regular exercise routine.

        Traumatic events usually happen quickly and chaotically. A near-miss experience occurs when you are involved in a traumatic event where you think you will die or be badly hurt, but are not. This can have a deep psychological impact, sometimes with lasting effects
      

        People with post-traumatic stress disorder often experience feelings of panic or extreme fear, which may resemble what was felt during the traumatic event.
      

        If you have survived a traumatic event, whether you were injured or not, it's important to recognise that trauma also causes emotional harm. Survival is often associated with complex emotional reactions that cause distress and make it hard to resume everyday life after the event. These are known as ‘survivor reactions’.
      

        Some survivors of torture and trauma live with their memories for years, or even for the rest of their lives.

        Motor neurone disease (MND) is also called amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Lou Gehrig's disease. MND is a rapidly progressing, neurological disease. Motor neurones are nerve cells that control the voluntary muscles of the trunk and limbs, and affect speech, swallowing and breathing. Damage to these nerves causes muscle weakness and wasting. People with MND become increasingly disabled, and may lose speech, have difficulty swallowing and eventually die from respiratory (breathing) failure.
      

        People with motor neurone disease can keep some independence and quality of life with the right help.
      

        A person with motor neurone disease may have difficulty with everyday items in their home.

        Many things can be done to manage, treat and sometimes cure incontinence and continence problems.
      

        Pelvic floor exercises are designed to improve muscle tone and prevent the need for corrective surgery.
      

        Your bladder is a hollow organ that stores urine from the kidneys.
      

        Exercise, a balanced diet and not smoking will help to keep your kidneys working well.
      

        Well-functioning kidneys are essential to a healthy life.

        Babies and young children are more likely to develop middle ear infections because they are still building up their immunity.
      

        In most cases, blockage of the ear canal with wax is a harmless event.
      

        The brain uses the inner ear, the eyes and muscles to pinpoint the position of the body at all times.
      

        In its earlier stages, an acoustic neuroma can present similar symptoms to other, less serious conditions, which may delay diagnosis and treatment.
      

        Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a condition characterised by episodes of sudden and severe vertigo.
      

        Dizziness is generally treatable and rarely indicates serious brain disease.
      

        It is estimated that around four out of five children will experience a middle ear infection at least once.
      

        Meniere's disease affects the ear, which is the centre of hearing and balance.

        Once hearing is damaged, it often can't be restored.
      

        Auditory neuropathy is hearing loss caused by a disruption of nerve impulses travelling from the inner ear to the brain.
      

        If you are unsure how to best communicate with a colleague who has a hearing impairment, ask them.
      

        Many people with hearing loss experience a drop in self-esteem and confidence because of their impaired ability to communicate.
      

        Lipreading can help people who are hearing impaired to cope better with their hearing loss.
      

        The earlier that hearing loss is identified in children, the better for the child?s language, learning and overall development.
      

        A ringing sensation in the ears (tinnitus), or people complaining that you talk too loudly are signs you may need to have your hearing checked.
      

        Like any language, Auslan continues to evolve to meet the communication needs of people who are deaf.
      

        Since adenoids are constantly in the path of germs, infections are common.

Meditation of one style or another can be found in most of the major religions, including Christianity, Judaism, Buddhism, Hinduism and Islam. Generally, Eastern religions have tended to concentrate on meditation as a means of realising spiritual enlightenment, a fundamental part of which has been the use of many health-promoting practices that go hand in hand with the spiritual ones. 
Many millions of people in the West and elsewhere in the world are active meditators. Meditation in the West is practiced for both health and religious or spiritual reasons, although many people regard it mainly as a self-help tool for improving cognitive (thought) performance and for managing stress. 
Meditating for spiritual expansion and fulfilment, without a religious basis, is becoming very common. 
Meditation produces a clearing of the mind in ways that promote a sense of calm and heightened awareness. Interestingly, measurements using electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) show that meditation can alter your brain’s activity.
When meditating alone or without guidance, it is important to remember that meditation is part of living a balanced life. It should not be used to withdraw from life or to avoid personal and practical issues. 
For a person with serious mental illness, meditation should be used under expert guidance, and if done alone, extreme caution should be taken.
Meditation has evolved out of numerous approaches to life, religions, philosophies and situations, which means there are many different techniques to choose from. Some examples include:
Whatever your preferred meditation technique, a common approach is to sit in a comfortable position in a quiet place for five minutes to half an hour without outside distractions. Set an alarm if you don’t want to lose track of time. Meditating every day at around the same time can help you develop a regular habit, and make it easier and quicker to slip into deeply meditative states. 
Contrary to popular belief, you don’t have to sit cross-legged on the floor in order to meditate. You can also sit in a chair or in bed. However, you might just fall asleep if you try to meditate lying down at night, which will defeat the purpose. 
Many people prefer to meditate while moving around. When meditating like this, it is important to make sure that your activities are an expression of inner focus, not a distraction from whatever you are experiencing. The activity is done slowly and attentively. 
People can meditate while walking, swimming or doing something repetitive that is not distracting (such as washing dishes, digging in the garden or sweeping). The activity is not the purpose – it is a means of focusing and holding attention on inner processes. 
You can master many meditation practices by yourself. However, some people prefer to attend classes or learn in a group from an experienced teacher.
Trying to meditate is a lot like trying to sleep – attempting to force it can often make it more difficult. Thinking of a meditation session as a chance to relax, rather than as a discipline you have to master, can make a big difference. 
If your attention wanders, try to practice acceptance and avoid getting annoyed with yourself. Simply direct your attention back to what you are doing and your experience of that moment.

If you have back pain, you’re not alone. It’s a common problem experienced by many Australians. In fact 1 in 6 Australians reported back problems in 2014–15. That’s 3.7 million people.
For most people back pain comes on quickly (acute back pain), but then improves or goes away within three to six weeks. However, it is common for it to come back, with some people going on to develop more persistent pain (that lasts for more than three months).
Back pain can have a significant impact on all aspects of life including daily activities, family life, work, recreation and social activities. But there’s a lot you and your healthcare team can do to deal with back pain so you can get on with life.
To understand your back pain, it’s helpful to know a little about how your back works. 
Your back is a complex structure that provides support for your pelvis, legs, ribcage, arms and skull. The spine is made up of bones called vertebrae that are stacked together to form a loose ‘S’-shaped column. 
Each vertebra is cushioned by spongy tissue called intervertebral discs. These discs act as shock absorbers and give your spine its flexibility. Vertebrae are joined by pairs of small joints known as ‘facet’ joints. A mesh of connective tissue called ligaments holds the spine together. 
Complex layers of muscle provide structural support and allow you to move. Your spinal cord runs through the centre of the vertebral column and connects your brain to the rest of your body.  
The causes of back pain are not fully understood. Most people with back pain don’t have any significant damage to their spine. The pain comes from the muscles, ligaments and joints.
Common causes of back pain include:
Some health conditions are also linked to back pain, such as:
There are also a number of things that can make it more likely that the back pain will become persistent, such as:
In a very small number of people, back problems are caused by a serious condition such as cancer, inflammatory problems, infection, fracture or compression of the nerves in the spine. However this is rare, and your doctor will check for these causes.
Back pain may be experienced anywhere along the spine – from the neck to the buttocks. In some cases, pain may also be felt in one or both legs. It’s common to be a bit restricted in daily activities such as bending, lifting, sitting and walking while you’re experiencing back pain. 
Movement of your torso may be limited by back pain. There may also be tenderness when pressure is applied to the joints of the spine. Reduction of reflexes, strength and sensation in the legs can be a sign of nerve compression.
It’s common for people with back pain to feel distressed about their recovery. People with persistent back pain can develop fear of movement and activity (including work), worrying that it will make things worse or increase their pain. Living with persistent back pain may also lead to mood issues, such as anxiety, irritability, frustration and depression.
Your doctor or healthcare clinician will:
Your doctor may refer you for some tests if they think there may be a more serious cause for your back pain. 
However, in most cases of back pain, imaging (such as x-rays, CT or MRI scans) is not useful and is not recommended. Unnecessary tests can be expensive, and some scans involve exposure to radiation that is better avoided if the results will not help with your treatment.
A thorough examination by your doctor will decide whether more investigations are appropriate or will be helpful in developing a treatment plan that is right for you. It is important to know that many investigations show ‘changes’ to your spine that are likely to represent the normal passage of time, not ‘damage’ to your spine.
For more information about questions to ask your doctor before you get any test, treatment or procedure, visit the Choosing Wisely  AustraliaExternal Link   website.  
Most people recover quickly from acute back pain, whether they seek treatment or manage by themselves. Over-the-counter pain relievers and staying active will help lessen pain and help you get on with your life.
There is also evidence to suggest that, as part of staying active, people with back pain should make efforts to remain at work, or return to work as soon as possible. By working together with your employer and healthcare team, you are more likely to recover and avoid the problems associated with long periods of time off work.
For more persistent pain, effective treatments include:
Surgery is rarely needed for back pain unless a more serious issue or condition is causing your back pain, or if nerve compression is present.   
Almost everyone suffers back pain at some stage in their lives. Most people recover quickly with little or no treatment. The best medicine involves staying active and at work whenever possible, as well as remaining positive about recovery.
Even in people with recurrent or persistent back pain, the most effective treatments involve things you can do yourself, such as: 
In most cases, acute back pain will get better within three to six weeks.
Some people can develop recurrent or persistent back pain, however working with your healthcare team and using self-management techniques will lead to the best outcomes. It is important to understand that, even with persistent back pain, most people are able to remain at work and lead a full life.

A joint is the part of the body where two or more bones meet to allow movement. Every bone in the body – except for the hyoid bone in the throat – meets up with at least one other bone at a joint. The shape of a joint depends on its function. A joint is also known as an articulation. 
Generally speaking, the more movement that is possible through a joint, the higher the risk of injury. This is because greater range of movement reduces the strength of the joint.
Joints are described by how much movement they allow. The three broad classes of joints include:

Joints are held together and supported by tough bands of connective tissue called ligaments. Smooth cartilage prevents friction as the bones move against one another. In freely movable joints, the entire joint is enclosed inside a membrane filled with lubricating synovial fluid, which helps to provide extra cushioning against impact. 
Muscles are attached to bones with thick, tough bands of connective tissue called tendons. Where tendons lie close to bone, tiny sacs called bursae sit between the tendon and the bone to reduce friction. A bursa is filled with synovial fluid.
Common causes of joint pain include:
