Yoga brings the body and mind together and is built on three main elements – movement, breathing and meditation. Yoga has many physical and mental health benefits including improved posture, flexibility, strength, balance and body awareness.
Always consult your doctor before embarking on any new fitness program, especially if you have a pre-existing medical condition or have not exercised in a long time.
Pilates and yoga are often thought to be one in the same, however Pilates traditionally focuses more on control of movement and muscular endurance as opposed to yoga which connects the body to the mind through flow of movement.
Yoga is an ancient Indian philosophy that dates back thousands of years. It was designed as a path to spiritual enlightenment, but in modern times, the physical aspects of yoga have found huge popularity as a gentle form of exercise and stress management. There are many different varieties of yoga, but each one essentially relies on structured poses (asanas) practiced with breath awareness.
Researchers have discovered that the regular practice of yoga may produce many health benefits, including increased cardiovascular fitness, improved muscular strength and normalisation of blood pressure. Yoga is a renowned antidote to stress and promotes improved sleeping patterns. Over time, those who practice yoga report lower levels of stress, and increased feelings of happiness and wellbeing. This is because concentrating on the postures and the breath acts as a form of meditation.
The classical techniques of yoga date back more than 5000 years. The practice of yoga encourages effort, intelligence, accuracy, thoroughness, commitment and dedication. The word yoga originates from the Sanskrit language and means ‘to join or yoke together’. It brings your body and mind together, and is built on three main elements – exercise, breathing and meditation.
The movements of yoga are designed to  challenge flexibility, balance, coordination and strength, increasing your body’s efficiency and overall health. Breathing techniques promote greater mind body connection, improving the  function of body and mind.
Focusing on controlled movement and breathing prepares the body and mind for meditation, with an approach to a quiet mind that allows silence and relief from everyday stress. When practiced regularly, yoga can become a powerful and sophisticated discipline for achieving physical, mental and emotional wellbeing.
There are many different varieties of yoga, each with a slightly different slant. The most popular are Hatha, Bikram, Iyengar, Yin and Vinyasa yoga.
Each yoga posture, or asana, is held for a period of time and linked with controlled breathing. Generally, a yoga session begins with gentle asanas and works up to more vigorous or challenging postures. A full yoga session should move every part of your body and should include pranayama (breath control practices), relaxation and meditation.
The different postures or asanas include:
The practice of yoga asanas develops strength and flexibility, while soothing your nerves and calming your mind. The asanas affect the muscles, joints and skin, and the whole body – glands, nerves, internal organs, bones, respiration and the brain. The physical building blocks of yoga are the posture and the breath.
Health benefits of yoga include:
Yoga is taught in classes, catering for beginners through to advanced participants. It is non-competitive and suitable for anyone, regardless of your age or fitness level. Your yoga teacher should carefully guide and observe you, and modify postures when necessary.
An asana should never cause pain. If you experience pain or discomfort, ease back on the stretch or don’t do it at all. It is important to keep within your physical limits.
If you are a male over 45 years of age or a female over 55 years of age, haven’t exercised for a long time or have a pre-existing medical condition, you should check with your preferred general practitioner or another suitably qualified professional before starting any new or regular exercise routine.

        Traumatic events usually happen quickly and chaotically. A near-miss experience occurs when you are involved in a traumatic event where you think you will die or be badly hurt, but are not. This can have a deep psychological impact, sometimes with lasting effects
      

        People with post-traumatic stress disorder often experience feelings of panic or extreme fear, which may resemble what was felt during the traumatic event.
      

        If you have survived a traumatic event, whether you were injured or not, it's important to recognise that trauma also causes emotional harm. Survival is often associated with complex emotional reactions that cause distress and make it hard to resume everyday life after the event. These are known as ‘survivor reactions’.
      

        Some survivors of torture and trauma live with their memories for years, or even for the rest of their lives.

        Motor neurone disease (MND) is also called amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Lou Gehrig's disease. MND is a rapidly progressing, neurological disease. Motor neurones are nerve cells that control the voluntary muscles of the trunk and limbs, and affect speech, swallowing and breathing. Damage to these nerves causes muscle weakness and wasting. People with MND become increasingly disabled, and may lose speech, have difficulty swallowing and eventually die from respiratory (breathing) failure.
      

        People with motor neurone disease can keep some independence and quality of life with the right help.
      

        A person with motor neurone disease may have difficulty with everyday items in their home.

        Many things can be done to manage, treat and sometimes cure incontinence and continence problems.
      

        Pelvic floor exercises are designed to improve muscle tone and prevent the need for corrective surgery.
      

        Your bladder is a hollow organ that stores urine from the kidneys.
      

        Exercise, a balanced diet and not smoking will help to keep your kidneys working well.
      

        Well-functioning kidneys are essential to a healthy life.

        Babies and young children are more likely to develop middle ear infections because they are still building up their immunity.
      

        In most cases, blockage of the ear canal with wax is a harmless event.
      

        The brain uses the inner ear, the eyes and muscles to pinpoint the position of the body at all times.
      

        In its earlier stages, an acoustic neuroma can present similar symptoms to other, less serious conditions, which may delay diagnosis and treatment.
      

        Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a condition characterised by episodes of sudden and severe vertigo.
      

        Dizziness is generally treatable and rarely indicates serious brain disease.
      

        It is estimated that around four out of five children will experience a middle ear infection at least once.
      

        Meniere's disease affects the ear, which is the centre of hearing and balance.

        Once hearing is damaged, it often can't be restored.
      

        Auditory neuropathy is hearing loss caused by a disruption of nerve impulses travelling from the inner ear to the brain.
      

        If you are unsure how to best communicate with a colleague who has a hearing impairment, ask them.
      

        Many people with hearing loss experience a drop in self-esteem and confidence because of their impaired ability to communicate.
      

        Lipreading can help people who are hearing impaired to cope better with their hearing loss.
      

        The earlier that hearing loss is identified in children, the better for the child?s language, learning and overall development.
      

        A ringing sensation in the ears (tinnitus), or people complaining that you talk too loudly are signs you may need to have your hearing checked.
      

        Like any language, Auslan continues to evolve to meet the communication needs of people who are deaf.
      

        Since adenoids are constantly in the path of germs, infections are common.

Meditation of one style or another can be found in most of the major religions, including Christianity, Judaism, Buddhism, Hinduism and Islam. Generally, Eastern religions have tended to concentrate on meditation as a means of realising spiritual enlightenment, a fundamental part of which has been the use of many health-promoting practices that go hand in hand with the spiritual ones. 
Many millions of people in the West and elsewhere in the world are active meditators. Meditation in the West is practiced for both health and religious or spiritual reasons, although many people regard it mainly as a self-help tool for improving cognitive (thought) performance and for managing stress. 
Meditating for spiritual expansion and fulfilment, without a religious basis, is becoming very common. 
Meditation produces a clearing of the mind in ways that promote a sense of calm and heightened awareness. Interestingly, measurements using electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) show that meditation can alter your brain’s activity.
When meditating alone or without guidance, it is important to remember that meditation is part of living a balanced life. It should not be used to withdraw from life or to avoid personal and practical issues. 
For a person with serious mental illness, meditation should be used under expert guidance, and if done alone, extreme caution should be taken.
Meditation has evolved out of numerous approaches to life, religions, philosophies and situations, which means there are many different techniques to choose from. Some examples include:
Whatever your preferred meditation technique, a common approach is to sit in a comfortable position in a quiet place for five minutes to half an hour without outside distractions. Set an alarm if you don’t want to lose track of time. Meditating every day at around the same time can help you develop a regular habit, and make it easier and quicker to slip into deeply meditative states. 
Contrary to popular belief, you don’t have to sit cross-legged on the floor in order to meditate. You can also sit in a chair or in bed. However, you might just fall asleep if you try to meditate lying down at night, which will defeat the purpose. 
Many people prefer to meditate while moving around. When meditating like this, it is important to make sure that your activities are an expression of inner focus, not a distraction from whatever you are experiencing. The activity is done slowly and attentively. 
People can meditate while walking, swimming or doing something repetitive that is not distracting (such as washing dishes, digging in the garden or sweeping). The activity is not the purpose – it is a means of focusing and holding attention on inner processes. 
You can master many meditation practices by yourself. However, some people prefer to attend classes or learn in a group from an experienced teacher.
Trying to meditate is a lot like trying to sleep – attempting to force it can often make it more difficult. Thinking of a meditation session as a chance to relax, rather than as a discipline you have to master, can make a big difference. 
If your attention wanders, try to practice acceptance and avoid getting annoyed with yourself. Simply direct your attention back to what you are doing and your experience of that moment.

If you have back pain, you’re not alone. It’s a common problem experienced by many Australians. In fact 1 in 6 Australians reported back problems in 2014–15. That’s 3.7 million people.
For most people back pain comes on quickly (acute back pain), but then improves or goes away within three to six weeks. However, it is common for it to come back, with some people going on to develop more persistent pain (that lasts for more than three months).
Back pain can have a significant impact on all aspects of life including daily activities, family life, work, recreation and social activities. But there’s a lot you and your healthcare team can do to deal with back pain so you can get on with life.
To understand your back pain, it’s helpful to know a little about how your back works. 
Your back is a complex structure that provides support for your pelvis, legs, ribcage, arms and skull. The spine is made up of bones called vertebrae that are stacked together to form a loose ‘S’-shaped column. 
Each vertebra is cushioned by spongy tissue called intervertebral discs. These discs act as shock absorbers and give your spine its flexibility. Vertebrae are joined by pairs of small joints known as ‘facet’ joints. A mesh of connective tissue called ligaments holds the spine together. 
Complex layers of muscle provide structural support and allow you to move. Your spinal cord runs through the centre of the vertebral column and connects your brain to the rest of your body.  
The causes of back pain are not fully understood. Most people with back pain don’t have any significant damage to their spine. The pain comes from the muscles, ligaments and joints.
Common causes of back pain include:
Some health conditions are also linked to back pain, such as:
There are also a number of things that can make it more likely that the back pain will become persistent, such as:
In a very small number of people, back problems are caused by a serious condition such as cancer, inflammatory problems, infection, fracture or compression of the nerves in the spine. However this is rare, and your doctor will check for these causes.
Back pain may be experienced anywhere along the spine – from the neck to the buttocks. In some cases, pain may also be felt in one or both legs. It’s common to be a bit restricted in daily activities such as bending, lifting, sitting and walking while you’re experiencing back pain. 
Movement of your torso may be limited by back pain. There may also be tenderness when pressure is applied to the joints of the spine. Reduction of reflexes, strength and sensation in the legs can be a sign of nerve compression.
It’s common for people with back pain to feel distressed about their recovery. People with persistent back pain can develop fear of movement and activity (including work), worrying that it will make things worse or increase their pain. Living with persistent back pain may also lead to mood issues, such as anxiety, irritability, frustration and depression.
Your doctor or healthcare clinician will:
Your doctor may refer you for some tests if they think there may be a more serious cause for your back pain. 
However, in most cases of back pain, imaging (such as x-rays, CT or MRI scans) is not useful and is not recommended. Unnecessary tests can be expensive, and some scans involve exposure to radiation that is better avoided if the results will not help with your treatment.
A thorough examination by your doctor will decide whether more investigations are appropriate or will be helpful in developing a treatment plan that is right for you. It is important to know that many investigations show ‘changes’ to your spine that are likely to represent the normal passage of time, not ‘damage’ to your spine.
For more information about questions to ask your doctor before you get any test, treatment or procedure, visit the Choosing Wisely  AustraliaExternal Link   website.  
Most people recover quickly from acute back pain, whether they seek treatment or manage by themselves. Over-the-counter pain relievers and staying active will help lessen pain and help you get on with your life.
There is also evidence to suggest that, as part of staying active, people with back pain should make efforts to remain at work, or return to work as soon as possible. By working together with your employer and healthcare team, you are more likely to recover and avoid the problems associated with long periods of time off work.
For more persistent pain, effective treatments include:
Surgery is rarely needed for back pain unless a more serious issue or condition is causing your back pain, or if nerve compression is present.   
Almost everyone suffers back pain at some stage in their lives. Most people recover quickly with little or no treatment. The best medicine involves staying active and at work whenever possible, as well as remaining positive about recovery.
Even in people with recurrent or persistent back pain, the most effective treatments involve things you can do yourself, such as: 
In most cases, acute back pain will get better within three to six weeks.
Some people can develop recurrent or persistent back pain, however working with your healthcare team and using self-management techniques will lead to the best outcomes. It is important to understand that, even with persistent back pain, most people are able to remain at work and lead a full life.

A joint is the part of the body where two or more bones meet to allow movement. Every bone in the body – except for the hyoid bone in the throat – meets up with at least one other bone at a joint. The shape of a joint depends on its function. A joint is also known as an articulation. 
Generally speaking, the more movement that is possible through a joint, the higher the risk of injury. This is because greater range of movement reduces the strength of the joint.
Joints are described by how much movement they allow. The three broad classes of joints include:

Joints are held together and supported by tough bands of connective tissue called ligaments. Smooth cartilage prevents friction as the bones move against one another. In freely movable joints, the entire joint is enclosed inside a membrane filled with lubricating synovial fluid, which helps to provide extra cushioning against impact. 
Muscles are attached to bones with thick, tough bands of connective tissue called tendons. Where tendons lie close to bone, tiny sacs called bursae sit between the tendon and the bone to reduce friction. A bursa is filled with synovial fluid.
Common causes of joint pain include:

Yoga brings the body and mind together and is built on three main elements – movement, breathing and meditation. Yoga has many physical and mental health benefits including improved posture, flexibility, strength, balance and body awareness.
Always consult your doctor before embarking on any new fitness program, especially if you have a pre-existing medical condition or have not exercised in a long time.
Pilates and yoga are often thought to be one in the same, however Pilates traditionally focuses more on control of movement and muscular endurance as opposed to yoga which connects the body to the mind through flow of movement.
Yoga is an ancient Indian philosophy that dates back thousands of years. It was designed as a path to spiritual enlightenment, but in modern times, the physical aspects of yoga have found huge popularity as a gentle form of exercise and stress management. There are many different varieties of yoga, but each one essentially relies on structured poses (asanas) practiced with breath awareness.
Researchers have discovered that the regular practice of yoga may produce many health benefits, including increased cardiovascular fitness, improved muscular strength and normalisation of blood pressure. Yoga is a renowned antidote to stress and promotes improved sleeping patterns. Over time, those who practice yoga report lower levels of stress, and increased feelings of happiness and wellbeing. This is because concentrating on the postures and the breath acts as a form of meditation.
The classical techniques of yoga date back more than 5000 years. The practice of yoga encourages effort, intelligence, accuracy, thoroughness, commitment and dedication. The word yoga originates from the Sanskrit language and means ‘to join or yoke together’. It brings your body and mind together, and is built on three main elements – exercise, breathing and meditation.
The movements of yoga are designed to  challenge flexibility, balance, coordination and strength, increasing your body’s efficiency and overall health. Breathing techniques promote greater mind body connection, improving the  function of body and mind.
Focusing on controlled movement and breathing prepares the body and mind for meditation, with an approach to a quiet mind that allows silence and relief from everyday stress. When practiced regularly, yoga can become a powerful and sophisticated discipline for achieving physical, mental and emotional wellbeing.
There are many different varieties of yoga, each with a slightly different slant. The most popular are Hatha, Bikram, Iyengar, Yin and Vinyasa yoga.
Each yoga posture, or asana, is held for a period of time and linked with controlled breathing. Generally, a yoga session begins with gentle asanas and works up to more vigorous or challenging postures. A full yoga session should move every part of your body and should include pranayama (breath control practices), relaxation and meditation.
The different postures or asanas include:
The practice of yoga asanas develops strength and flexibility, while soothing your nerves and calming your mind. The asanas affect the muscles, joints and skin, and the whole body – glands, nerves, internal organs, bones, respiration and the brain. The physical building blocks of yoga are the posture and the breath.
Health benefits of yoga include:
Yoga is taught in classes, catering for beginners through to advanced participants. It is non-competitive and suitable for anyone, regardless of your age or fitness level. Your yoga teacher should carefully guide and observe you, and modify postures when necessary.
An asana should never cause pain. If you experience pain or discomfort, ease back on the stretch or don’t do it at all. It is important to keep within your physical limits.
If you are a male over 45 years of age or a female over 55 years of age, haven’t exercised for a long time or have a pre-existing medical condition, you should check with your preferred general practitioner or another suitably qualified professional before starting any new or regular exercise routine.
Pre-exercise  screeningExternal Link   is used to identify people with medical conditions or contraindications that may put them at a higher risk of experiencing an adverse event during physical activity. It is a tool to help decide if the potential benefits of exercise outweigh the risks for you and whether you should seek further guidance from an allied health or medical professional.
Yoga classes usually have 10 to 20 people, allowing for individual attention. Suggestions for getting the most out of your yoga class include:

Fatigue is a feeling of constant exhaustion, burnout or lack of energy. It can be physical, mental or a combination of both. Fatigue can affect anyone – most adults experience it at some time in their life.
Each year, many Australians see their doctor about fatigue. Fatigue is a symptom, not a condition. 
For many people, fatigue is caused by a combination of lifestyle, social, psychological and general wellbeing issues rather than an underlying medical condition.
Although fatigue is sometimes described as tiredness, it is more severe than being tired at the end of a long day or from hard physical exercise.  Everyone can feel tired at times, but this is usually resolved with a nap or a few nights of good sleep.  
If you are getting enough sleep, eating healthily and exercising regularly but struggle with motivation, concentration and going about your daily activities, you may be experiencing fatigue that needs further investigation.
Sometimes fatigue can be more serious – it may indicate an underlying medical condition or it can put people at risk of a workplace or motor vehicle accident.
If fatigue is having a negative effect on how you live your life, or causing you distress, it is important to speak with your general practitioner (GP). 
Fatigue symptoms can be physical, mental and emotional and may include:
The wide range of causes that can trigger fatigue include:
Fatigue can also be caused by a number of factors working in combination.
It is often hard to work out the exact cause of fatigue because can be a symptom of many medical conditions (such as anaemia, multiple sclerosis and cancer).
See your doctor if you experience prolonged bouts of fatigue. They will look at both medical and non-medical areas of your life to determine the cause and may ask how fatigue is impacting your life. 
Ongoing unexplained fatigue (or chronic fatigue) is distinct from myalgic encephalomyelitis (known as chronic fatigue syndrome or ME/CFS) in the following way:
If you’ve have ongoing, unexplained fatigue for more than 6 months and feel worse after activity, you might have ME/CFS. See your doctor for advice.
Common lifestyle factors that can cause fatigue include:
Common workplace issues that may contribute to fatigue include:
Psychological factors are a common cause of fatigue. These may include:
Your doctor may:
Your healthcare provider will work with you to make changes to reduce your fatigue. These might include lifestyle changes or medical interventions such as:  
Fortunately for most people, fatigue will get better over time on its own or with some simple and practical lifestyle changes.

Meditation of one style or another can be found in most of the major religions, including Christianity, Judaism, Buddhism, Hinduism and Islam. Generally, Eastern religions have tended to concentrate on meditation as a means of realising spiritual enlightenment, a fundamental part of which has been the use of many health-promoting practices that go hand in hand with the spiritual ones. 
Many millions of people in the West and elsewhere in the world are active meditators. Meditation in the West is practiced for both health and religious or spiritual reasons, although many people regard it mainly as a self-help tool for improving cognitive (thought) performance and for managing stress. 
Meditating for spiritual expansion and fulfilment, without a religious basis, is becoming very common. 
Meditation produces a clearing of the mind in ways that promote a sense of calm and heightened awareness. Interestingly, measurements using electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) show that meditation can alter your brain’s activity.
When meditating alone or without guidance, it is important to remember that meditation is part of living a balanced life. It should not be used to withdraw from life or to avoid personal and practical issues. 
For a person with serious mental illness, meditation should be used under expert guidance, and if done alone, extreme caution should be taken.
Meditation has evolved out of numerous approaches to life, religions, philosophies and situations, which means there are many different techniques to choose from. Some examples include:
Whatever your preferred meditation technique, a common approach is to sit in a comfortable position in a quiet place for five minutes to half an hour without outside distractions. Set an alarm if you don’t want to lose track of time. Meditating every day at around the same time can help you develop a regular habit, and make it easier and quicker to slip into deeply meditative states. 
Contrary to popular belief, you don’t have to sit cross-legged on the floor in order to meditate. You can also sit in a chair or in bed. However, you might just fall asleep if you try to meditate lying down at night, which will defeat the purpose. 
Many people prefer to meditate while moving around. When meditating like this, it is important to make sure that your activities are an expression of inner focus, not a distraction from whatever you are experiencing. The activity is done slowly and attentively. 
People can meditate while walking, swimming or doing something repetitive that is not distracting (such as washing dishes, digging in the garden or sweeping). The activity is not the purpose – it is a means of focusing and holding attention on inner processes. 
You can master many meditation practices by yourself. However, some people prefer to attend classes or learn in a group from an experienced teacher.
Trying to meditate is a lot like trying to sleep – attempting to force it can often make it more difficult. Thinking of a meditation session as a chance to relax, rather than as a discipline you have to master, can make a big difference. 
If your attention wanders, try to practice acceptance and avoid getting annoyed with yourself. Simply direct your attention back to what you are doing and your experience of that moment.

        People with dementia continue to need loving, safe relationships and caring touch.

Yoga brings the body and mind together and is built on three main elements – movement, breathing and meditation. Yoga has many physical and mental health benefits including improved posture, flexibility, strength, balance and body awareness.
Always consult your doctor before embarking on any new fitness program, especially if you have a pre-existing medical condition or have not exercised in a long time.
Pilates and yoga are often thought to be one in the same, however Pilates traditionally focuses more on control of movement and muscular endurance as opposed to yoga which connects the body to the mind through flow of movement.
Yoga is an ancient Indian philosophy that dates back thousands of years. It was designed as a path to spiritual enlightenment, but in modern times, the physical aspects of yoga have found huge popularity as a gentle form of exercise and stress management. There are many different varieties of yoga, but each one essentially relies on structured poses (asanas) practiced with breath awareness.
Researchers have discovered that the regular practice of yoga may produce many health benefits, including increased cardiovascular fitness, improved muscular strength and normalisation of blood pressure. Yoga is a renowned antidote to stress and promotes improved sleeping patterns. Over time, those who practice yoga report lower levels of stress, and increased feelings of happiness and wellbeing. This is because concentrating on the postures and the breath acts as a form of meditation.
The classical techniques of yoga date back more than 5000 years. The practice of yoga encourages effort, intelligence, accuracy, thoroughness, commitment and dedication. The word yoga originates from the Sanskrit language and means ‘to join or yoke together’. It brings your body and mind together, and is built on three main elements – exercise, breathing and meditation.
The movements of yoga are designed to  challenge flexibility, balance, coordination and strength, increasing your body’s efficiency and overall health. Breathing techniques promote greater mind body connection, improving the  function of body and mind.
Focusing on controlled movement and breathing prepares the body and mind for meditation, with an approach to a quiet mind that allows silence and relief from everyday stress. When practiced regularly, yoga can become a powerful and sophisticated discipline for achieving physical, mental and emotional wellbeing.
There are many different varieties of yoga, each with a slightly different slant. The most popular are Hatha, Bikram, Iyengar, Yin and Vinyasa yoga.
Each yoga posture, or asana, is held for a period of time and linked with controlled breathing. Generally, a yoga session begins with gentle asanas and works up to more vigorous or challenging postures. A full yoga session should move every part of your body and should include pranayama (breath control practices), relaxation and meditation.
The different postures or asanas include:
The practice of yoga asanas develops strength and flexibility, while soothing your nerves and calming your mind. The asanas affect the muscles, joints and skin, and the whole body – glands, nerves, internal organs, bones, respiration and the brain. The physical building blocks of yoga are the posture and the breath.
Health benefits of yoga include:
Yoga is taught in classes, catering for beginners through to advanced participants. It is non-competitive and suitable for anyone, regardless of your age or fitness level. Your yoga teacher should carefully guide and observe you, and modify postures when necessary.
An asana should never cause pain. If you experience pain or discomfort, ease back on the stretch or don’t do it at all. It is important to keep within your physical limits.
If you are a male over 45 years of age or a female over 55 years of age, haven’t exercised for a long time or have a pre-existing medical condition, you should check with your preferred general practitioner or another suitably qualified professional before starting any new or regular exercise routine.
Pre-exercise  screeningExternal Link   is used to identify people with medical conditions or contraindications that may put them at a higher risk of experiencing an adverse event during physical activity. It is a tool to help decide if the potential benefits of exercise outweigh the risks for you and whether you should seek further guidance from an allied health or medical professional.
Yoga classes usually have 10 to 20 people, allowing for individual attention. Suggestions for getting the most out of your yoga class include:

A joint is the part of the body where two or more bones meet to allow movement. Every bone in the body – except for the hyoid bone in the throat – meets up with at least one other bone at a joint. The shape of a joint depends on its function. A joint is also known as an articulation. 
Generally speaking, the more movement that is possible through a joint, the higher the risk of injury. This is because greater range of movement reduces the strength of the joint.
Joints are described by how much movement they allow. The three broad classes of joints include:
The six types of freely movable joint include:
To achieve movement, the joint may:
Joints are held together and supported by tough bands of connective tissue called ligaments. Smooth cartilage prevents friction as the bones move against one another. In freely movable joints, the entire joint is enclosed inside a membrane filled with lubricating synovial fluid, which helps to provide extra cushioning against impact. 
Muscles are attached to bones with thick, tough bands of connective tissue called tendons. Where tendons lie close to bone, tiny sacs called bursae sit between the tendon and the bone to reduce friction. A bursa is filled with synovial fluid.
Common causes of joint pain include:

You probably have some idea of how fit you are. However, assessing and recording baseline (starting) fitness scores can give you benchmarks (points of comparison) against which to measure your progress. It’s valuable to assess your progress on a regular basis, for example each month. Remembering progression with some goals may be achieved in shorter or longer periods of time.
Before you start your new exercise program, record:
(Note: Some medications affect your heart rate. If you are taking any medications that do so, consult a health professional and consider another way of measuring your exertion levels, such as the Borg scale.) The adult pre-exercise screening tool contains exercise intensity guidelines, including exertion and other descriptive measures. 
Consult an exercise or health professional to help you interpret this information or to do a fitness assessment for you, and work out what sort of program is best for you.
Consulting an exercise professional when designing your fitness program can help you reduce injury and customise your program to your needs, especially if you are new to exercise or you haven’t done any physical activity for a while. Points to keep in mind when designing your program include:

For more information, visit our fact sheet Physical activity – how to get started.
Assess your progress six weeks after you start your program (by measuring the same parameters as you did to record your baseline fitness) and then every eight to 12 weeks. You may need to adjust the time, intensity and type of exercise you do to continue improving. On the other hand, you may be pleasantly surprised to find that you’re exercising just the right amount to meet your fitness goals.
If you start to lose motivation, set new goals or try a new activity. Exercising with a friend or taking a class at a local fitness centre may help.

Pilates (or the Pilates method) is a series of exercises inspired by calisthenics, yoga and ballet. Pilates promotes mobility and strength of all the major muscle groups in the body in a balanced fashion, whilst also having a key focus on the deep core muscles. It improves posture, flexibility, strength, balance and body awareness.
Always consult your doctor before embarking on any new fitness program, especially if you have a pre-existing medical condition or have not exercised in a long time.
In the 1920s, physical trainer Joseph Pilates recognised modern lifestyles and their impacts on balance, posture and overall physical health. Inspired by his own complications as a child and by different forms of movement, he worked hard to improve his body. With great success he became stronger, more flexible and overall healthier. Following this, he introduced this way of movement what was to be later called Pilates into America as a way to help injured athletes and dancers safely return to exercise and maintain their fitness. Since then, Pilates has been adapted to suit people in the general community.
Pilates can be an aerobic and non-aerobic form of exercise. It requires concentration and focus, because you move your body through precise ranges of motion.  It requires concentration in finding a centre point to control your body through movement. Each exercise has a prescribed placement, rhythm and breathing pattern.
In Pilates, your muscles are rarely worked to the point of exhaustion, so there is not always sweating or straining, just intense concentration. The workout consists of a variety of exercise sequences that are performed in low repetitions, usually five to ten times, over a session of 45 to 90 minutes. Floor based exercises performed on a mat and specialised equipment for resistance are often used.
The Pilates method is taught to suit each person and exercises are regularly re-evaluated to ensure they are appropriate for that person. Due to the individual attention, this method can suit everybody from elite athletes to people with limited mobility, pregnant women and people with low fitness levels.
Classes are held in specialised Pilates studios, physiotherapy clinics or at your local leisure facility or community centre.
The health benefits of Pilates include:
Pilates caters for everyone, from beginner to advanced. You can perform exercises using your own body weight, or with the help of various pieces of equipment.
A typical Pilates workout includes a number of exercises and stretches. Each exercise is performed with attention to correct breathing techniques and abdominal muscle control. To gain the maximum benefit, you should do Pilates at least two or three times per week. You may notice postural improvements after 10 to 20 sessions.
Pilates and Yoga are often thought to be one in the same, however Pilates traditionally focuses more on control of movement and muscular endurance as opposed to yoga which connects the body to the mind through flow of movement.
The two basic forms of Pilates are:
Some forms of Pilates include weights (such as dumbbells) and other types of small equipment that offer resistance to the muscles.
Pilates consists of moving through a slow, sustained series of exercises using abdominal control and proper breathing. The quality of each posture is more important than the number of repetitions or how energetically you can move.
Books, online videos and other resources are available, however seek instruction from a qualified Pilates professional teacher/instructor or physiotherapist to get the best results.
Although Pilates is a low-impact form of exercise, certain people should seek professional advice before embarking on a new program, including:

Your heart is a vital organ. It is a muscle that pumps blood to all parts of your body. The blood pumped by your heart provides your body with the oxygen and nutrients it needs to function.
Your heart is about the size of a clenched fist, and weighs between 300 and 450 g. It lies in the middle of your chest, behind and slightly to the left of your breastbone. 
If you are of average body weight and size, your body contains about five litres of blood, all of which passes through your heart every minute or so. When necessary, such as during exercise, your heart can pump up to four times that amount per minute.
Your heart has a right and left side separated by a wall called the septum. On each side of the wall, there is a small collecting chamber called an ‘atrium’, which leads into a large pumping chamber called a ‘ventricle’. There are four chambers: the left atrium and right atrium (upper chambers), and the left ventricle and right ventricle (lower chambers).
The right side of your heart collects blood on its return from the rest of your body. The blood entering the right side of your heart is low in oxygen. Your heart pumps the blood from the right side of your heart to your lungs so it can receive more oxygen. 
Once it has received oxygen, the blood returns directly to the left side of your heart, which then pumps it out again to all parts of your body through an artery called the aorta. 
Blood pressure refers to the amount of force the pumping blood exerts on arterial walls.
Each atrium is connected to its ventricle by a one-way valve. The valve on the right side of the heart is called the tricuspid valve, while the valve on the left side is called the mitral valve. 
The familiar 'lub-dub' sound of the heartbeat is caused by the rhythmic closing of the heart valves as blood is pumped in and out of the chambers. 
The heart rate is regulated by a special cluster of cells in the right atrium, called the sinus node. The sinus node  prompts the upper chambers to contract first. Then, an electrical impulse is sent to a second cluster of cells (the atrioventricular node), which is found between the upper and lower chambers of the heart. The electrical impulse causes the lower chambers to contract. At rest, your heart beats approximately 60 to 100 times a minute.
The blood vessels of the heart include:
There are many different types of heart conditions. Some common heart conditions include:
‘Heart disease’ is a broad term for different conditions affecting the heart. 
Different heart conditions can have different symptoms. 
It’s important to be aware of the following symptoms, which can be a warning sign of a medical emergency, including a heart attack:
If your symptoms last more than 10 minutes, are severe or getting worse, call triple zero (000) immediately for an ambulance.

Yoga brings the body and mind together and is built on three main elements – movement, breathing and meditation. Yoga has many physical and mental health benefits including improved posture, flexibility, strength, balance and body awareness.
Always consult your doctor before embarking on any new fitness program, especially if you have a pre-existing medical condition or have not exercised in a long time.
Pilates and yoga are often thought to be one in the same, however Pilates traditionally focuses more on control of movement and muscular endurance as opposed to yoga which connects the body to the mind through flow of movement.
Yoga is an ancient Indian philosophy that dates back thousands of years. It was designed as a path to spiritual enlightenment, but in modern times, the physical aspects of yoga have found huge popularity as a gentle form of exercise and stress management. There are many different varieties of yoga, but each one essentially relies on structured poses (asanas) practiced with breath awareness.
Researchers have discovered that the regular practice of yoga may produce many health benefits, including increased cardiovascular fitness, improved muscular strength and normalisation of blood pressure. Yoga is a renowned antidote to stress and promotes improved sleeping patterns. Over time, those who practice yoga report lower levels of stress, and increased feelings of happiness and wellbeing. This is because concentrating on the postures and the breath acts as a form of meditation.
The classical techniques of yoga date back more than 5000 years. The practice of yoga encourages effort, intelligence, accuracy, thoroughness, commitment and dedication. The word yoga originates from the Sanskrit language and means ‘to join or yoke together’. It brings your body and mind together, and is built on three main elements – exercise, breathing and meditation.
The movements of yoga are designed to  challenge flexibility, balance, coordination and strength, increasing your body’s efficiency and overall health. Breathing techniques promote greater mind body connection, improving the  function of body and mind.
Focusing on controlled movement and breathing prepares the body and mind for meditation, with an approach to a quiet mind that allows silence and relief from everyday stress. When practiced regularly, yoga can become a powerful and sophisticated discipline for achieving physical, mental and emotional wellbeing.
There are many different varieties of yoga, each with a slightly different slant. The most popular are Hatha, Bikram, Iyengar, Yin and Vinyasa yoga.
Each yoga posture, or asana, is held for a period of time and linked with controlled breathing. Generally, a yoga session begins with gentle asanas and works up to more vigorous or challenging postures. A full yoga session should move every part of your body and should include pranayama (breath control practices), relaxation and meditation.
The different postures or asanas include:
The practice of yoga asanas develops strength and flexibility, while soothing your nerves and calming your mind. The asanas affect the muscles, joints and skin, and the whole body – glands, nerves, internal organs, bones, respiration and the brain. The physical building blocks of yoga are the posture and the breath.
Health benefits of yoga include:
Yoga is taught in classes, catering for beginners through to advanced participants. It is non-competitive and suitable for anyone, regardless of your age or fitness level. Your yoga teacher should carefully guide and observe you, and modify postures when necessary.
An asana should never cause pain. If you experience pain or discomfort, ease back on the stretch or don’t do it at all. It is important to keep within your physical limits.
If you are a male over 45 years of age or a female over 55 years of age, haven’t exercised for a long time or have a pre-existing medical condition, you should check with your preferred general practitioner or another suitably qualified professional before starting any new or regular exercise routine.

Always consult your doctor before embarking on any new fitness program, especially if you have a pre-existing medical condition or have not exercised in a long time.
Pilates and yoga are often thought to be one in the same, however Pilates traditionally focuses more on control of movement and muscular endurance as opposed to yoga which connects the body to the mind through flow of movement.
Yoga is an ancient Indian philosophy that dates back thousands of years. It was designed as a path to spiritual enlightenment, but in modern times, the physical aspects of yoga have found huge popularity as a gentle form of exercise and stress management. There are many different varieties of yoga, but each one essentially relies on structured poses (asanas) practiced with breath awareness.
Researchers have discovered that the regular practice of yoga may produce many health benefits, including increased cardiovascular fitness, improved muscular strength and normalisation of blood pressure. Yoga is a renowned antidote to stress and promotes improved sleeping patterns. Over time, those who practice yoga report lower levels of stress, and increased feelings of happiness and wellbeing. This is because concentrating on the postures and the breath acts as a form of meditation.
The classical techniques of yoga date back more than 5000 years. The practice of yoga encourages effort, intelligence, accuracy, thoroughness, commitment and dedication. The word yoga originates from the Sanskrit language and means ‘to join or yoke together’. It brings your body and mind together, and is built on three main elements – exercise, breathing and meditation.
The movements of yoga are designed to  challenge flexibility, balance, coordination and strength, increasing your body’s efficiency and overall health. Breathing techniques promote greater mind body connection, improving the  function of body and mind.
Focusing on controlled movement and breathing prepares the body and mind for meditation, with an approach to a quiet mind that allows silence and relief from everyday stress. When practiced regularly, yoga can become a powerful and sophisticated discipline for achieving physical, mental and emotional wellbeing.
There are many different varieties of yoga, each with a slightly different slant. The most popular are Hatha, Bikram, Iyengar, Yin and Vinyasa yoga.
Each yoga posture, or asana, is held for a period of time and linked with controlled breathing. Generally, a yoga session begins with gentle asanas and works up to more vigorous or challenging postures. A full yoga session should move every part of your body and should include pranayama (breath control practices), relaxation and meditation.
The different postures or asanas include:
The practice of yoga asanas develops strength and flexibility, while soothing your nerves and calming your mind. The asanas affect the muscles, joints and skin, and the whole body – glands, nerves, internal organs, bones, respiration and the brain. The physical building blocks of yoga are the posture and the breath.
Health benefits of yoga include:
Yoga is taught in classes, catering for beginners through to advanced participants. It is non-competitive and suitable for anyone, regardless of your age or fitness level. Your yoga teacher should carefully guide and observe you, and modify postures when necessary.
An asana should never cause pain. If you experience pain or discomfort, ease back on the stretch or don’t do it at all. It is important to keep within your physical limits.
If you are a male over 45 years of age or a female over 55 years of age, haven’t exercised for a long time or have a pre-existing medical condition, you should check with your preferred general practitioner or another suitably qualified professional before starting any new or regular exercise routine.
Pre-exercise  screeningExternal Link   is used to identify people with medical conditions or contraindications that may put them at a higher risk of experiencing an adverse event during physical activity. It is a tool to help decide if the potential benefits of exercise outweigh the risks for you and whether you should seek further guidance from an allied health or medical professional.

Yoga brings the body and mind together and is built on three main elements – movement, breathing and meditation. Yoga has many physical and mental health benefits including improved posture, flexibility, strength, balance and body awareness.
Always consult your doctor before embarking on any new fitness program, especially if you have a pre-existing medical condition or have not exercised in a long time.
Pilates and yoga are often thought to be one in the same, however Pilates traditionally focuses more on control of movement and muscular endurance as opposed to yoga which connects the body to the mind through flow of movement.
Yoga is an ancient Indian philosophy that dates back thousands of years. It was designed as a path to spiritual enlightenment, but in modern times, the physical aspects of yoga have found huge popularity as a gentle form of exercise and stress management. There are many different varieties of yoga, but each one essentially relies on structured poses (asanas) practiced with breath awareness.
Researchers have discovered that the regular practice of yoga may produce many health benefits, including increased cardiovascular fitness, improved muscular strength and normalisation of blood pressure. Yoga is a renowned antidote to stress and promotes improved sleeping patterns. Over time, those who practice yoga report lower levels of stress, and increased feelings of happiness and wellbeing. This is because concentrating on the postures and the breath acts as a form of meditation.
The classical techniques of yoga date back more than 5000 years. The practice of yoga encourages effort, intelligence, accuracy, thoroughness, commitment and dedication. The word yoga originates from the Sanskrit language and means ‘to join or yoke together’. It brings your body and mind together, and is built on three main elements – exercise, breathing and meditation.
The movements of yoga are designed to  challenge flexibility, balance, coordination and strength, increasing your body’s efficiency and overall health. Breathing techniques promote greater mind body connection, improving the  function of body and mind.
Focusing on controlled movement and breathing prepares the body and mind for meditation, with an approach to a quiet mind that allows silence and relief from everyday stress. When practiced regularly, yoga can become a powerful and sophisticated discipline for achieving physical, mental and emotional wellbeing.
There are many different varieties of yoga, each with a slightly different slant. The most popular are Hatha, Bikram, Iyengar, Yin and Vinyasa yoga.
Each yoga posture, or asana, is held for a period of time and linked with controlled breathing. Generally, a yoga session begins with gentle asanas and works up to more vigorous or challenging postures. A full yoga session should move every part of your body and should include pranayama (breath control practices), relaxation and meditation.
The different postures or asanas include:
The practice of yoga asanas develops strength and flexibility, while soothing your nerves and calming your mind. The asanas affect the muscles, joints and skin, and the whole body – glands, nerves, internal organs, bones, respiration and the brain. The physical building blocks of yoga are the posture and the breath.
Health benefits of yoga include:
Yoga is taught in classes, catering for beginners through to advanced participants. It is non-competitive and suitable for anyone, regardless of your age or fitness level. Your yoga teacher should carefully guide and observe you, and modify postures when necessary.
An asana should never cause pain. If you experience pain or discomfort, ease back on the stretch or don’t do it at all. It is important to keep within your physical limits.
If you are a male over 45 years of age or a female over 55 years of age, haven’t exercised for a long time or have a pre-existing medical condition, you should check with your preferred general practitioner or another suitably qualified professional before starting any new or regular exercise routine.
Pre-exercise  screeningExternal Link   is used to identify people with medical conditions or contraindications that may put them at a higher risk of experiencing an adverse event during physical activity. It is a tool to help decide if the potential benefits of exercise outweigh the risks for you and whether you should seek further guidance from an allied health or medical professional.
Yoga classes usually have 10 to 20 people, allowing for individual attention. Suggestions for getting the most out of your yoga class include:

        Traumatic events usually happen quickly and chaotically. A near-miss experience occurs when you are involved in a traumatic event where you think you will die or be badly hurt, but are not. This can have a deep psychological impact, sometimes with lasting effects

Yoga brings the body and mind together and is built on three main elements – movement, breathing and meditation. Yoga has many physical and mental health benefits including improved posture, flexibility, strength, balance and body awareness.
Always consult your doctor before embarking on any new fitness program, especially if you have a pre-existing medical condition or have not exercised in a long time.
Pilates and yoga are often thought to be one in the same, however Pilates traditionally focuses more on control of movement and muscular endurance as opposed to yoga which connects the body to the mind through flow of movement.
Yoga is an ancient Indian philosophy that dates back thousands of years. It was designed as a path to spiritual enlightenment, but in modern times, the physical aspects of yoga have found huge popularity as a gentle form of exercise and stress management. There are many different varieties of yoga, but each one essentially relies on structured poses (asanas) practiced with breath awareness.
Researchers have discovered that the regular practice of yoga may produce many health benefits, including increased cardiovascular fitness, improved muscular strength and normalisation of blood pressure. Yoga is a renowned antidote to stress and promotes improved sleeping patterns. Over time, those who practice yoga report lower levels of stress, and increased feelings of happiness and wellbeing. This is because concentrating on the postures and the breath acts as a form of meditation.
The classical techniques of yoga date back more than 5000 years. The practice of yoga encourages effort, intelligence, accuracy, thoroughness, commitment and dedication. The word yoga originates from the Sanskrit language and means ‘to join or yoke together’. It brings your body and mind together, and is built on three main elements – exercise, breathing and meditation.
The movements of yoga are designed to  challenge flexibility, balance, coordination and strength, increasing your body’s efficiency and overall health. Breathing techniques promote greater mind body connection, improving the  function of body and mind.
Focusing on controlled movement and breathing prepares the body and mind for meditation, with an approach to a quiet mind that allows silence and relief from everyday stress. When practiced regularly, yoga can become a powerful and sophisticated discipline for achieving physical, mental and emotional wellbeing.
There are many different varieties of yoga, each with a slightly different slant. The most popular are Hatha, Bikram, Iyengar, Yin and Vinyasa yoga.
Each yoga posture, or asana, is held for a period of time and linked with controlled breathing. Generally, a yoga session begins with gentle asanas and works up to more vigorous or challenging postures. A full yoga session should move every part of your body and should include pranayama (breath control practices), relaxation and meditation.
The different postures or asanas include:
The practice of yoga asanas develops strength and flexibility, while soothing your nerves and calming your mind. The asanas affect the muscles, joints and skin, and the whole body – glands, nerves, internal organs, bones, respiration and the brain. The physical building blocks of yoga are the posture and the breath.
Health benefits of yoga include:
Yoga is taught in classes, catering for beginners through to advanced participants. It is non-competitive and suitable for anyone, regardless of your age or fitness level. Your yoga teacher should carefully guide and observe you, and modify postures when necessary.
An asana should never cause pain. If you experience pain or discomfort, ease back on the stretch or don’t do it at all. It is important to keep within your physical limits.
If you are a male over 45 years of age or a female over 55 years of age, haven’t exercised for a long time or have a pre-existing medical condition, you should check with your preferred general practitioner or another suitably qualified professional before starting any new or regular exercise routine.
Pre-exercise  screeningExternal Link   is used to identify people with medical conditions or contraindications that may put them at a higher risk of experiencing an adverse event during physical activity. It is a tool to help decide if the potential benefits of exercise outweigh the risks for you and whether you should seek further guidance from an allied health or medical professional.
Yoga classes usually have 10 to 20 people, allowing for individual attention. Suggestions for getting the most out of your yoga class include:

        Babies and young children are more likely to develop middle ear infections because they are still building up their immunity.
      

        In most cases, blockage of the ear canal with wax is a harmless event.
      

        The brain uses the inner ear, the eyes and muscles to pinpoint the position of the body at all times.
      

        In its earlier stages, an acoustic neuroma can present similar symptoms to other, less serious conditions, which may delay diagnosis and treatment.

Stress is a process, not a diagnosis. We experience stress when there is an imbalance between the demands being made on us and our resources to cope with those demands. The level and extent of stress a person may feel depends a lot on their attitude to a particular situation. An event that may be extremely stressful for one person can be a mere hiccup in another person’s life.
You may feel under pressure to do something and fear you may fail. The more important the outcome, the more stressed you feel. You can feel stressed by external situations (too much work, children misbehaving) and by internal triggers (the way you think about external situations).
Stress is not always a bad thing. Some people thrive on stress and even need it to get things done. When the term ‘stress’ is used in a clinical sense, it refers to a situation that causes discomfort and distress for a person and can lead to other mental health problems, such as anxiety and depression.
Stress may also contribute to physical illness such as cardiovascular disease. When stress turns into a serious illness, it’s important to get professional help as soon as possible. Untreated anxiety disorders can lead to serious depression.
Stress affects us in many ways, including: 
Your attitude, personality and approach to life will influence how you respond to stress. Factors that play a part include: 
As a health problem, stress occurs when a person feels that the demands made on them exceed their ability to cope. Factors contributing to a person feeling stressed might include: 
When we feel under stress, our body kicks into high gear to deal with the threat. Our heartbeat, breathing rate and blood pressure all go up. The longer we feel stressed, the greater the demand on our body. 
The more often we are placed under stress, the more often we have to use energy to cope. There is growing evidence that stress may contribute to physical illness such as cardiovascular disease (although this link remains controversial and research is ongoing), high blood pressure, proneness to infection and chronic fatigue. 
Whatever the cause, physical diseases need appropriate medical management before any attempt is made at stress management. Discuss with your doctor how stress management may be used to support treatment of your physical symptoms.
Untreated stress can turn into a mental illness such as an anxiety disorder or depression. 
Almost everyone experiences some anxiety. This is normal. However, an anxiety disorder is different from everyday anxiety – it is more severe, can persist and may interfere with a person’s daily life. 
Common anxiety disorders include: 
A less common anxiety disorder is acute stress disorder.
Anxiety is a very treatable condition. There are many different psychological and medication options. Treatments need to be individually decided on and regularly reviewed to make sure they are effective and to minimise side effects of medications. Separately and in combination, psychotherapy and medication therapy generally produce good results.
Untreated anxiety disorders can lead to serious depression. Depressive illness is common – about 17 per cent of Australians will suffer from depression at some time in their life. 
Depression is about twice as common in women as in men. The most common time in life for people to suffer from depression is in their 40s. However, it can develop at any age. Depression is often associated with an increased incidence of suicide. The annual suicide rate for people with depression is three or four times higher than that of other psychiatric disorders.
Stress in the workplace is common and is caused by many different factors, including excessive hours, conflicts with others and feelings of isolation. The amount of stress a person experiences is often determined by whether or not they can accept that some things in life will simply never be sorted out to their satisfaction. For example, a person may feel stressed by the way they are treated by their employer or by the behaviour of a work colleague. 
Sometimes, this stress can be resolved by dealing with the particular behaviour. In many organisations, there are processes to deal with workplace problems like harassment, victimisation or unfair treatment. In many cases, the problem can be resolved if the behaviour is changed. 
However, some problems will never be fully resolved, and you may have to accept them. For example, if someone who you think is poorly qualified is given a job you felt entitled to, you may continue to feel stressed, unless you are able to let go of that grievance and move on.
The old saying ‘prevention is better than cure’ is certainly true for stress management. It will help if you: 
To deal with stress more effectively, it helps to investigate your stresses and how you react to them. Try to:

        Weight loss is often associated with Huntington's disease, but it doesn?t appear to be a direct result of diet.
      

        Motor neurone disease (MND) is also called amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Lou Gehrig's disease. MND is a rapidly progressing, neurological disease. Motor neurones are nerve cells that control the voluntary muscles of the trunk and limbs, and affect speech, swallowing and breathing. Damage to these nerves causes muscle weakness and wasting. People with MND become increasingly disabled, and may lose speech, have difficulty swallowing and eventually die from respiratory (breathing) failure.
      

        People with motor neurone disease can keep some independence and quality of life with the right help.
      

        A person with motor neurone disease may have difficulty with everyday items in their home.
      

        Problems using the toilet and bathroom can be stressful for both the person with motor neurone disease and their carer.

Blood pressure is the pressure of blood on the walls of your arteries as your heart  pumps blood around your body. Blood pressure does not stay the same all the time. It changes to meet your body’s needs and it is normal for your blood pressure to go up and down throughout the day. It is affected by various factors, including body position, breathing, emotional state, exercise and sleep.If blood pressure remains high over a long period of time, it can lead to a heart attack, stroke, heart failure or kidney disease. 
The medical name for high blood pressure is hypertension.  The medical name for low blood pressure is hypotension.
Blood pressure is recorded as two numbers, such as 120/80. The larger number is the pressure in the arteries as the heart pumps out blood during each beat. This is called the systolic blood pressure.The lower number is the pressure as the heart relaxes before the next beat. This is called the diastolic blood pressure. Both are measured in units called millimetres of mercury (mmHg).
It is best to measure blood pressure when you are relaxed and sitting. Blood pressure is usually measured with an inflatable pressure cuff that wraps around your upper arm. This cuff is part of a machine called a sphygmomanometer.
Your blood pressure changes to meet your body’s needs. If a reading is high, your doctor may measure your blood pressure again on several separate occasions before diagnosing high blood pressure.
Your doctor may recommend that you have your blood pressure recorded at home with a monitoring device. This is also known as 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and it involves measuring your blood pressure at regular intervals (usually every 20-30 minutes), while you do your usual activities including sleeping.  Your doctor will organise this service if required.  
If you are considering buying a blood pressure device to use at home, it is best to speak to your doctor to see if this is needed. If so, then buy a device that measures blood pressure accurately. See this list of devices that have been approved by the British and Irish Hypertension Society.  
What is considered a healthy blood pressure varies from person to person. Your doctor will explain what your ideal blood pressure is based on a range of factors, including your overall health.The following numbers should only be used as a guide:
High blood pressure usually does not have any symptoms. You can have high blood pressure and feel perfectly well. The only way to find out if your blood pressure is high is to have it checked regularly by your doctor.
Low blood pressure can be  a problem if it has a negative impact on your body or affects the way you feel. Low blood pressure can make people feel dizzy or faint. See you doctor if you think you have low blood pressure.
Get your blood pressure checked every two years if your blood pressure is in the healthy range and:
Your doctor can also check your blood pressure during routine visits.
You should have your blood pressure checked more frequently (such as every 12 months or as directed by your doctor) if:
You can also have your blood pressure checked as part of a Heart Health Check. A Heart Health Check is a 20-minute check up with your doctor (GP) which is subsidised by Medicare. You are eligible for a Heart Health Check if you: 
As part of a Heart Health check, your doctor will: 
Your doctor will then use this information to calculate your risk of having a heart attack or stroke over the next five years. Your doctor will then discuss how you can lower your risk. 
If your blood pressure remains high, it can lead to serious conditions like a heart attack, heart failure, stroke or kidney disease. Your risk will depend on any other modifiable or non-modifiable risk factors you might have. 
Modifiable risk factors are factors that you can change. Non-modifiable risk factors are factors you can’t change. 
Heart attack and stroke risk factors that you can change include:
There are also some health conditions that increase risk:
Risk factors you can’t change include:
Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander Peoples and people from some ethnic backgrounds (South Asian, Middle Eastern, Māori or Pacific Islander) are also at increased risk.
Your doctor will support you to make changes to manage your blood pressure: 
Your doctor may also recommend you take medicines to manage your blood pressure. Even if you need to take medicines, it’s still important for make healthy changes too. 
Tobacco smoking is a major risk factor for heart disease and can increase blood pressure. Stopping smoking is one of the best things you can do to help manage your blood pressure. Every cigarette that you don’t smoke is doing you good. 
The most effective way to stop smoking is with a combination of:
There is also evidence that e-cigarettes can increase heart rate and blood pressure, which may increase the risk of heart disease. If you are ready to quit smoking or thinking about quitting smoking, talk to your doctor about ways to help you give up smoking. You can also call the  QuitlineExternal Link   (Tel. 13 78 48) 
The Heart Foundation recommends people follow a heart-healthy eating pattern. Heart-healthy eating is  importantExternal Link   for managing blood pressure and reducing the risk of heart  diseaseExternal Link  .
This way of eating is naturally low in unhealthy fats, salt and added sugar. It’s rich in wholegrains, fibre, antioxidants and healthy fats.
Check out the Heart Foundation  websiteExternal Link   for a range of resources to help you follow a heart-healthy eating pattern.
For individualised nutrition advice, you can also speak to an Accredited Practising  DietitianExternal Link  .  
Salt is a mineral made up of sodium and chloride. It’s the sodium in salt that is bad for your health. When looking at food labels on groceries, it is the sodium that is listed. 
Reducing the amount of salt  (sodium)External Link   you eat can help to manage your blood pressure. The Heart Foundation recommends five grams of salt (about a teaspoon) as a daily maximum. 
In addition to following a heart-healthy eating pattern, follow these top tips to reduce your salt intake: 
Being physically active is a great way to manage your blood pressure and reduce your risk of heart disease. 
All types of physical activity count.  Walking, cycling, swimming and yoga are all great for your health. It’s important to do activities you enjoy as you are more likely to keep active if you are having fun. It is recommended that you:
Walking is a great activity for heart health and managing blood pressure. Getting involved with a Heart Foundation Walking group is a fun and social way to be active.  You can also register for a free Personal Walking Plan. Visit Heart Foundation Walking for more  informationExternal Link  . 
Alcohol isn’t a necessary or recommended part of a heart-healthy eating pattern.  Drinking alcohol can increase blood pressure and the risk of heart disease.  
If you don’t drink alcohol, don’t start. If you do drink alcohol, the Heart Foundation recommends following the National Health and Medical Research Council’s (NHMRC) recommended levels of alcohol consumption: 
Speak to your doctor for advice and support to cut down on alcohol. 
 MedicinesExternal Link   are available to lower and manage high blood pressure. Your doctor may call them ‘antihypertensives’, (which basically means ‘anti’ – against and ‘hypertensive’ – high blood pressure). 
Medicines for high blood pressure can include: 
These medicines help maintain a healthy blood pressure to improve the flow of oxygen and blood around the body. Some help the heart to pump more easily and efficiently. 
Once you start to take medicines to manage your blood pressure, you may need to take them for the rest of your life. However, the dose of these medicines may change over time. If your doctor recommends you take blood pressure medicines, it’s still important to make healthy choices when it comes to your diet and physical activity. 
If you need to take medicines, your doctor will advise you on the correct type and dose. Two or more different medicines are often needed to manage blood pressure.
Make sure you take your medicines regularly. Some things that may help you remember to take them include:
Take any blood pressure medicine exactly as prescribed. Don’t stop or change your medicine unless your doctor advises you to.

Yoga brings the body and mind together and is built on three main elements – movement, breathing and meditation. Yoga has many physical and mental health benefits including improved posture, flexibility, strength, balance and body awareness.
Always consult your doctor before embarking on any new fitness program, especially if you have a pre-existing medical condition or have not exercised in a long time.
Pilates and yoga are often thought to be one in the same, however Pilates traditionally focuses more on control of movement and muscular endurance as opposed to yoga which connects the body to the mind through flow of movement.
Yoga is an ancient Indian philosophy that dates back thousands of years. It was designed as a path to spiritual enlightenment, but in modern times, the physical aspects of yoga have found huge popularity as a gentle form of exercise and stress management. There are many different varieties of yoga, but each one essentially relies on structured poses (asanas) practiced with breath awareness.
Researchers have discovered that the regular practice of yoga may produce many health benefits, including increased cardiovascular fitness, improved muscular strength and normalisation of blood pressure. Yoga is a renowned antidote to stress and promotes improved sleeping patterns. Over time, those who practice yoga report lower levels of stress, and increased feelings of happiness and wellbeing. This is because concentrating on the postures and the breath acts as a form of meditation.
The classical techniques of yoga date back more than 5000 years. The practice of yoga encourages effort, intelligence, accuracy, thoroughness, commitment and dedication. The word yoga originates from the Sanskrit language and means ‘to join or yoke together’. It brings your body and mind together, and is built on three main elements – exercise, breathing and meditation.
The movements of yoga are designed to  challenge flexibility, balance, coordination and strength, increasing your body’s efficiency and overall health. Breathing techniques promote greater mind body connection, improving the  function of body and mind.
Focusing on controlled movement and breathing prepares the body and mind for meditation, with an approach to a quiet mind that allows silence and relief from everyday stress. When practiced regularly, yoga can become a powerful and sophisticated discipline for achieving physical, mental and emotional wellbeing.
There are many different varieties of yoga, each with a slightly different slant. The most popular are Hatha, Bikram, Iyengar, Yin and Vinyasa yoga.
Each yoga posture, or asana, is held for a period of time and linked with controlled breathing. Generally, a yoga session begins with gentle asanas and works up to more vigorous or challenging postures. A full yoga session should move every part of your body and should include pranayama (breath control practices), relaxation and meditation.
The different postures or asanas include:
The practice of yoga asanas develops strength and flexibility, while soothing your nerves and calming your mind. The asanas affect the muscles, joints and skin, and the whole body – glands, nerves, internal organs, bones, respiration and the brain. The physical building blocks of yoga are the posture and the breath.
Health benefits of yoga include:
Yoga is taught in classes, catering for beginners through to advanced participants. It is non-competitive and suitable for anyone, regardless of your age or fitness level. Your yoga teacher should carefully guide and observe you, and modify postures when necessary.
An asana should never cause pain. If you experience pain or discomfort, ease back on the stretch or don’t do it at all. It is important to keep within your physical limits.
If you are a male over 45 years of age or a female over 55 years of age, haven’t exercised for a long time or have a pre-existing medical condition, you should check with your preferred general practitioner or another suitably qualified professional before starting any new or regular exercise routine.
Pre-exercise  screeningExternal Link   is used to identify people with medical conditions or contraindications that may put them at a higher risk of experiencing an adverse event during physical activity. It is a tool to help decide if the potential benefits of exercise outweigh the risks for you and whether you should seek further guidance from an allied health or medical professional.
Yoga classes usually have 10 to 20 people, allowing for individual attention. Suggestions for getting the most out of your yoga class include:

The nervous system helps all the parts of the body to communicate with each other. It also reacts to changes both outside and inside the body. The nervous system uses both electrical and chemical means to send and receive messages.
The basic building block of the nervous system is a nerve cell, or neurone. Neurones are shaped differently depending on where they are in the body and what role they play. All neurones have finger-like projections called dendrites and a long fibre called an axon. 
In many cases, the axon is coated by a specialised membrane called a myelin sheath. The axon feathers out and has a number of bumps on it. Each bump sits near to a dendrite from another neurone. The space between the bump and the dendrite is called a synapse. Messages jump the synapse from one neurone to the next, using special chemicals called neurotransmitters. 
Unlike other cells in the body, neurones aren’t easily replaced if they die or are damaged by infection or injury.
The brain and the spinal cord make up the central nervous system. They are wrapped in a thin lining called meninges and bathed with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).
The brain is the powerhouse of the body, even though it only makes up 2 per cent of the body’s weight. This soft, jelly-like organ has countless billions of neural cross-connections. The brain oversees the workings of the body, while its higher functions give us consciousness and personality.
The spinal cord is connected to the brain and runs the length of the body. It is protected by the bones of the spine (vertebrae). Nerves branch off from the spinal cord into the arms, legs and torso.
Nerves connect the brain and spinal cord to the peripheral nervous system, which is what nerve tissue outside of the central nervous system is called. It is made up of two main parts: the autonomic and the somatic nervous systems.
The autonomic nervous system is part of the peripheral nervous system. One of its main roles is to regulate glands and organs without any effort from our conscious minds. 
The autonomic nervous system is made up of two parts: the sympathetic and the parasympathetic. These systems act on the body in opposite ways. Together, they coordinate a multitude of adjustments required for our changing personal needs as we move through our environment. For example, the size of our pupils is adjusted automatically to allow the correct amount of light into our eyes for optimum vision, our sweat glands are turned on when we get too hot and our salivary glands produce saliva when we eat food (or even think about it!).
The somatic nervous system is also a part of the peripheral nervous system. One of its roles is to relay information from the eyes, ears, skin and muscle to the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord). It also obeys commands from the central nervous system and makes muscles contract or relax, allowing us to move.
Some common problems of the nervous system include:

Yoga brings the body and mind together and is built on three main elements – movement, breathing and meditation. Yoga has many physical and mental health benefits including improved posture, flexibility, strength, balance and body awareness.
Always consult your doctor before embarking on any new fitness program, especially if you have a pre-existing medical condition or have not exercised in a long time.
Pilates and yoga are often thought to be one in the same, however Pilates traditionally focuses more on control of movement and muscular endurance as opposed to yoga which connects the body to the mind through flow of movement.
Yoga is an ancient Indian philosophy that dates back thousands of years. It was designed as a path to spiritual enlightenment, but in modern times, the physical aspects of yoga have found huge popularity as a gentle form of exercise and stress management. There are many different varieties of yoga, but each one essentially relies on structured poses (asanas) practiced with breath awareness.
Researchers have discovered that the regular practice of yoga may produce many health benefits, including increased cardiovascular fitness, improved muscular strength and normalisation of blood pressure. Yoga is a renowned antidote to stress and promotes improved sleeping patterns. Over time, those who practice yoga report lower levels of stress, and increased feelings of happiness and wellbeing. This is because concentrating on the postures and the breath acts as a form of meditation.
The classical techniques of yoga date back more than 5000 years. The practice of yoga encourages effort, intelligence, accuracy, thoroughness, commitment and dedication. The word yoga originates from the Sanskrit language and means ‘to join or yoke together’. It brings your body and mind together, and is built on three main elements – exercise, breathing and meditation.
The movements of yoga are designed to  challenge flexibility, balance, coordination and strength, increasing your body’s efficiency and overall health. Breathing techniques promote greater mind body connection, improving the  function of body and mind.
Focusing on controlled movement and breathing prepares the body and mind for meditation, with an approach to a quiet mind that allows silence and relief from everyday stress. When practiced regularly, yoga can become a powerful and sophisticated discipline for achieving physical, mental and emotional wellbeing.
There are many different varieties of yoga, each with a slightly different slant. The most popular are Hatha, Bikram, Iyengar, Yin and Vinyasa yoga.
Each yoga posture, or asana, is held for a period of time and linked with controlled breathing. Generally, a yoga session begins with gentle asanas and works up to more vigorous or challenging postures. A full yoga session should move every part of your body and should include pranayama (breath control practices), relaxation and meditation.
The different postures or asanas include:
The practice of yoga asanas develops strength and flexibility, while soothing your nerves and calming your mind. The asanas affect the muscles, joints and skin, and the whole body – glands, nerves, internal organs, bones, respiration and the brain. The physical building blocks of yoga are the posture and the breath.
Health benefits of yoga include:
Yoga is taught in classes, catering for beginners through to advanced participants. It is non-competitive and suitable for anyone, regardless of your age or fitness level. Your yoga teacher should carefully guide and observe you, and modify postures when necessary.
An asana should never cause pain. If you experience pain or discomfort, ease back on the stretch or don’t do it at all. It is important to keep within your physical limits.
If you are a male over 45 years of age or a female over 55 years of age, haven’t exercised for a long time or have a pre-existing medical condition, you should check with your preferred general practitioner or another suitably qualified professional before starting any new or regular exercise routine.
Pre-exercise  screeningExternal Link   is used to identify people with medical conditions or contraindications that may put them at a higher risk of experiencing an adverse event during physical activity. It is a tool to help decide if the potential benefits of exercise outweigh the risks for you and whether you should seek further guidance from an allied health or medical professional.
Yoga classes usually have 10 to 20 people, allowing for individual attention. Suggestions for getting the most out of your yoga class include:

        Traumatic events usually happen quickly and chaotically. A near-miss experience occurs when you are involved in a traumatic event where you think you will die or be badly hurt, but are not. This can have a deep psychological impact, sometimes with lasting effects
      

        People with post-traumatic stress disorder often experience feelings of panic or extreme fear, which may resemble what was felt during the traumatic event.
      

        If you have survived a traumatic event, whether you were injured or not, it's important to recognise that trauma also causes emotional harm. Survival is often associated with complex emotional reactions that cause distress and make it hard to resume everyday life after the event. These are known as ‘survivor reactions’.

Yoga brings the body and mind together and is built on three main elements – movement, breathing and meditation. Yoga has many physical and mental health benefits including improved posture, flexibility, strength, balance and body awareness.
Always consult your doctor before embarking on any new fitness program, especially if you have a pre-existing medical condition or have not exercised in a long time.
Pilates and yoga are often thought to be one in the same, however Pilates traditionally focuses more on control of movement and muscular endurance as opposed to yoga which connects the body to the mind through flow of movement.
Yoga is an ancient Indian philosophy that dates back thousands of years. It was designed as a path to spiritual enlightenment, but in modern times, the physical aspects of yoga have found huge popularity as a gentle form of exercise and stress management. There are many different varieties of yoga, but each one essentially relies on structured poses (asanas) practiced with breath awareness.
Researchers have discovered that the regular practice of yoga may produce many health benefits, including increased cardiovascular fitness, improved muscular strength and normalisation of blood pressure. Yoga is a renowned antidote to stress and promotes improved sleeping patterns. Over time, those who practice yoga report lower levels of stress, and increased feelings of happiness and wellbeing. This is because concentrating on the postures and the breath acts as a form of meditation.
The classical techniques of yoga date back more than 5000 years. The practice of yoga encourages effort, intelligence, accuracy, thoroughness, commitment and dedication. The word yoga originates from the Sanskrit language and means ‘to join or yoke together’. It brings your body and mind together, and is built on three main elements – exercise, breathing and meditation.
The movements of yoga are designed to  challenge flexibility, balance, coordination and strength, increasing your body’s efficiency and overall health. Breathing techniques promote greater mind body connection, improving the  function of body and mind.
Focusing on controlled movement and breathing prepares the body and mind for meditation, with an approach to a quiet mind that allows silence and relief from everyday stress. When practiced regularly, yoga can become a powerful and sophisticated discipline for achieving physical, mental and emotional wellbeing.
There are many different varieties of yoga, each with a slightly different slant. The most popular are Hatha, Bikram, Iyengar, Yin and Vinyasa yoga.
Each yoga posture, or asana, is held for a period of time and linked with controlled breathing. Generally, a yoga session begins with gentle asanas and works up to more vigorous or challenging postures. A full yoga session should move every part of your body and should include pranayama (breath control practices), relaxation and meditation.
The different postures or asanas include:
The practice of yoga asanas develops strength and flexibility, while soothing your nerves and calming your mind. The asanas affect the muscles, joints and skin, and the whole body – glands, nerves, internal organs, bones, respiration and the brain. The physical building blocks of yoga are the posture and the breath.
Health benefits of yoga include:
Yoga is taught in classes, catering for beginners through to advanced participants. It is non-competitive and suitable for anyone, regardless of your age or fitness level. Your yoga teacher should carefully guide and observe you, and modify postures when necessary.
An asana should never cause pain. If you experience pain or discomfort, ease back on the stretch or don’t do it at all. It is important to keep within your physical limits.
If you are a male over 45 years of age or a female over 55 years of age, haven’t exercised for a long time or have a pre-existing medical condition, you should check with your preferred general practitioner or another suitably qualified professional before starting any new or regular exercise routine.
Pre-exercise  screeningExternal Link   is used to identify people with medical conditions or contraindications that may put them at a higher risk of experiencing an adverse event during physical activity. It is a tool to help decide if the potential benefits of exercise outweigh the risks for you and whether you should seek further guidance from an allied health or medical professional.

Anxiety disorders are a group of mental health problems. They include generalised anxiety disorders, social phobias, specific phobias (for example, agoraphobia and claustrophobia), and panic disorders. Depression is often related to anxiety disorders.
Anxiety disorders are common mental health problems that affect many people. Approximately 25% of the population have an anxiety disorder that warrants treatment at some time in their life and up to another 25% have less severe anxieties such as fears of spider and snakes.
Everyone experiences anxiety and fear at times – these are normal and helpful human emotions that help us deal with danger. However, some people experience excessive and irrational anxiety and worries that become ongoing and distressing, and that interfere with their daily lives. This may indicate an anxiety disorder. Often there appears to be no obvious or logical reason for the way the person feels. This may make an anxiety disorder even more worrying to the sufferer.
The main features of an anxiety disorder are fears or thoughts that are chronic (constant) and distressing and that interfere with daily living. Other symptoms of an anxiety disorder may include:
A panic attack is a sudden feeling of intense terror that may occur in certain situations or for no apparent reason. A panic attack does not mean a person is necessarily suffering an anxiety disorder. However, a panic attack is a common feature of each type of anxiety disorder.
Symptoms of a panic attack may include:
The cause of panic attacks is unknown, but they may be related to a chemical response in the brain, caused by actual threatening or stressful events or by thinking about stressful events. The brain response leads to physiological changes in the body, such as shallow breathing and rapid heartbeat.
Panic attacks can be frightening. Some people say they feel like they are going to die or go crazy. People affected by panic attacks may avoid situations in which they think attacks might occur. In some cases, this may lead to the development of other anxiety disorders including agoraphobia.
Anxiety becomes a disorder when it’s irrational, excessive and when it interferes with a person’s ability to function in daily life. Anxiety disorders include:
Generalised anxiety is excessive anxiety and constant worry about many things. The focus of the anxiety might be family or friends, health, work, money or forgetting important appointments. A person may be diagnosed with a generalised anxiety disorder if:
People with social phobia are afraid of being negatively judged or evaluated by others. This leads to fear of doing something that may humiliate them in public – for example public speaking, using public toilets, eating and drinking in public, writing in public, or any social encounters such as parties or workplaces.
Some social phobia sufferers may only fear one type of situation. Others may be concerned about several types of situations. This can lead them to avoid the feared situations, which can then lead to severe isolation and avoiding people and activities they usually enjoy.
A person with a specific phobia has a persistent and irrational fear of a particular object or situation. They may fear animals, places or people. Fear of the object or situation is so severe that a person may experience physical symptoms and panic attacks. Fears may include dogs, blood, storms, spiders or other objects or situations but, in all cases, the anxiety is both excessive and interfering.
The adult phobia sufferer usually knows that their fear is excessive or unreasonable. However, their need to avoid the object, place or person can significantly restrict their life.
Panic or anxiety attacks are common. Panic disorders are less common, affecting about 2% of the population. For a person to be diagnosed with a panic disorder, they would usually have had at least four panic attacks each month over an extended period of time. Often panic attacks may not be related to a situation but come on spontaneously. 
Panic disorder may be diagnosed if panic attacks are frequent and if there’s a strong and persistent fear of another attack occurring.
An anxiety disorder may lead to social isolation and clinical depression, and can impair a person’s ability to work, study and do routine activities. It may also hurt relationships with friends, family and colleagues. It’s common for depression and anxiety to happen at the same time. Depression can be a serious illness with a high risk of self-harm and suicide.
Recovery from an anxiety disorder is possible with the right treatment and support. Effective treatments for anxiety disorders may include:

Yoga brings the body and mind together and is built on three main elements – movement, breathing and meditation. Yoga has many physical and mental health benefits including improved posture, flexibility, strength, balance and body awareness.
Always consult your doctor before embarking on any new fitness program, especially if you have a pre-existing medical condition or have not exercised in a long time.
Pilates and yoga are often thought to be one in the same, however Pilates traditionally focuses more on control of movement and muscular endurance as opposed to yoga which connects the body to the mind through flow of movement.
Yoga is an ancient Indian philosophy that dates back thousands of years. It was designed as a path to spiritual enlightenment, but in modern times, the physical aspects of yoga have found huge popularity as a gentle form of exercise and stress management. There are many different varieties of yoga, but each one essentially relies on structured poses (asanas) practiced with breath awareness.
Researchers have discovered that the regular practice of yoga may produce many health benefits, including increased cardiovascular fitness, improved muscular strength and normalisation of blood pressure. Yoga is a renowned antidote to stress and promotes improved sleeping patterns. Over time, those who practice yoga report lower levels of stress, and increased feelings of happiness and wellbeing. This is because concentrating on the postures and the breath acts as a form of meditation.
The classical techniques of yoga date back more than 5000 years. The practice of yoga encourages effort, intelligence, accuracy, thoroughness, commitment and dedication. The word yoga originates from the Sanskrit language and means ‘to join or yoke together’. It brings your body and mind together, and is built on three main elements – exercise, breathing and meditation.
The movements of yoga are designed to  challenge flexibility, balance, coordination and strength, increasing your body’s efficiency and overall health. Breathing techniques promote greater mind body connection, improving the  function of body and mind.
Focusing on controlled movement and breathing prepares the body and mind for meditation, with an approach to a quiet mind that allows silence and relief from everyday stress. When practiced regularly, yoga can become a powerful and sophisticated discipline for achieving physical, mental and emotional wellbeing.
There are many different varieties of yoga, each with a slightly different slant. The most popular are Hatha, Bikram, Iyengar, Yin and Vinyasa yoga.
Each yoga posture, or asana, is held for a period of time and linked with controlled breathing. Generally, a yoga session begins with gentle asanas and works up to more vigorous or challenging postures. A full yoga session should move every part of your body and should include pranayama (breath control practices), relaxation and meditation.
The different postures or asanas include:
The practice of yoga asanas develops strength and flexibility, while soothing your nerves and calming your mind. The asanas affect the muscles, joints and skin, and the whole body – glands, nerves, internal organs, bones, respiration and the brain. The physical building blocks of yoga are the posture and the breath.
Health benefits of yoga include:
Yoga is taught in classes, catering for beginners through to advanced participants. It is non-competitive and suitable for anyone, regardless of your age or fitness level. Your yoga teacher should carefully guide and observe you, and modify postures when necessary.
An asana should never cause pain. If you experience pain or discomfort, ease back on the stretch or don’t do it at all. It is important to keep within your physical limits.
If you are a male over 45 years of age or a female over 55 years of age, haven’t exercised for a long time or have a pre-existing medical condition, you should check with your preferred general practitioner or another suitably qualified professional before starting any new or regular exercise routine.
Pre-exercise  screeningExternal Link   is used to identify people with medical conditions or contraindications that may put them at a higher risk of experiencing an adverse event during physical activity. It is a tool to help decide if the potential benefits of exercise outweigh the risks for you and whether you should seek further guidance from an allied health or medical professional.
Yoga classes usually have 10 to 20 people, allowing for individual attention. Suggestions for getting the most out of your yoga class include:

Parents teach their children to be fearful and cautious of specific dangers, such as fire or crossing the road. In these instances, anxiety can be useful, because it helps protect the child from harm. However, children can be fearful of situations or objects that adults don’t find threatening. 
The sources of fear may change as the child matures. For example, a fear of the dark or of monsters under the bed may give way to fears of burglary or violence. Tactics that don’t work include teasing the child for being afraid or forcing them to confront frightening situations. 
Help your child to deal with fear by taking their feelings seriously, encouraging them to talk about their anxieties, telling them the facts and giving them the opportunity to confront their fears at their own pace and with your support.
Some children are more fearful than others. Contributing factors may include:
Once a baby has reached 6 or 7 months of age, they have formed strong attachments to their parents or caregivers. Separation from their ‘special people’, even for short periods of time, can cause considerable anxiety and plenty of crying. Similarly, many babies prefer the exclusive company of their special people so much that they develop a fear of strangers for a while. Babies grow out of this phase with time. 
Suggestions for helping your baby cope with separation anxiety and fear of strangers include:
Children aged around 2 to 3 years are only just starting to learn how to cope with their strong feelings, such as anger. A common fear for a toddler is that they will be overwhelmed by powerful emotions. 
Toddlers have a limited understanding of size and may develop seemingly irrational fears, such as falling down the plughole or toilet. 
Suggestions for helping your toddler include:
As a child learns more about the world, the list of things they fear tends to grow. Some fears are real and some are imaginary. Common fears include fear of the dark, burglary, war, death, separation or divorce of their parents, and supernatural beings (such as ghosts and monsters). 
Suggestions for helping your child include:
Many children are afraid of the dark. A toddler or preschooler tends to be afraid of unfamiliar things that they don’t understand or can’t control. Their active imaginations, and their inability to always distinguish between reality and fantasy, means they may believe that monsters are under the bed or in the wardrobe waiting to spring once the light goes out. 
If not addressed, a child’s fear of the dark may linger and continue to disrupt their bedtime routine and sleeping habits. There are many ways that parents can help their child to overcome a fear of the dark.
As with other fears, it is important to handle a child’s fear of the dark with sympathy and understanding. Do not ridicule or dismiss your child’s feelings, or become frustrated and angry. The first step in helping your child to overcome their irrational fear is to accept their feelings as real and respond to them sensitively. 
Suggestions include:
Practical ways to deal with your child’s fear of the dark include:
Sometimes a child is so fearful that it interferes with their daily life and play. Seek professional help if you consider your child is particularly burdened with fears or phobias. Children can be taught how to manage their own anxiety, and parents can learn helping strategies.

Meditation of one style or another can be found in most of the major religions, including Christianity, Judaism, Buddhism, Hinduism and Islam. Generally, Eastern religions have tended to concentrate on meditation as a means of realising spiritual enlightenment, a fundamental part of which has been the use of many health-promoting practices that go hand in hand with the spiritual ones. 
Many millions of people in the West and elsewhere in the world are active meditators. Meditation in the West is practiced for both health and religious or spiritual reasons, although many people regard it mainly as a self-help tool for improving cognitive (thought) performance and for managing stress. 
Meditating for spiritual expansion and fulfilment, without a religious basis, is becoming very common. 
Meditation produces a clearing of the mind in ways that promote a sense of calm and heightened awareness. Interestingly, measurements using electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) show that meditation can alter your brain’s activity.
When meditating alone or without guidance, it is important to remember that meditation is part of living a balanced life. It should not be used to withdraw from life or to avoid personal and practical issues. 
For a person with serious mental illness, meditation should be used under expert guidance, and if done alone, extreme caution should be taken.
Meditation has evolved out of numerous approaches to life, religions, philosophies and situations, which means there are many different techniques to choose from. Some examples include:
Whatever your preferred meditation technique, a common approach is to sit in a comfortable position in a quiet place for five minutes to half an hour without outside distractions. Set an alarm if you don’t want to lose track of time. Meditating every day at around the same time can help you develop a regular habit, and make it easier and quicker to slip into deeply meditative states. 
Contrary to popular belief, you don’t have to sit cross-legged on the floor in order to meditate. You can also sit in a chair or in bed. However, you might just fall asleep if you try to meditate lying down at night, which will defeat the purpose. 
Many people prefer to meditate while moving around. When meditating like this, it is important to make sure that your activities are an expression of inner focus, not a distraction from whatever you are experiencing. The activity is done slowly and attentively. 
People can meditate while walking, swimming or doing something repetitive that is not distracting (such as washing dishes, digging in the garden or sweeping). The activity is not the purpose – it is a means of focusing and holding attention on inner processes. 
You can master many meditation practices by yourself. However, some people prefer to attend classes or learn in a group from an experienced teacher.
Trying to meditate is a lot like trying to sleep – attempting to force it can often make it more difficult. Thinking of a meditation session as a chance to relax, rather than as a discipline you have to master, can make a big difference. 
If your attention wanders, try to practice acceptance and avoid getting annoyed with yourself. Simply direct your attention back to what you are doing and your experience of that moment.

Yoga brings the body and mind together and is built on three main elements – movement, breathing and meditation. Yoga has many physical and mental health benefits including improved posture, flexibility, strength, balance and body awareness.
Always consult your doctor before embarking on any new fitness program, especially if you have a pre-existing medical condition or have not exercised in a long time.
Pilates and yoga are often thought to be one in the same, however Pilates traditionally focuses more on control of movement and muscular endurance as opposed to yoga which connects the body to the mind through flow of movement.
Yoga is an ancient Indian philosophy that dates back thousands of years. It was designed as a path to spiritual enlightenment, but in modern times, the physical aspects of yoga have found huge popularity as a gentle form of exercise and stress management. There are many different varieties of yoga, but each one essentially relies on structured poses (asanas) practiced with breath awareness.
Researchers have discovered that the regular practice of yoga may produce many health benefits, including increased cardiovascular fitness, improved muscular strength and normalisation of blood pressure. Yoga is a renowned antidote to stress and promotes improved sleeping patterns. Over time, those who practice yoga report lower levels of stress, and increased feelings of happiness and wellbeing. This is because concentrating on the postures and the breath acts as a form of meditation.
The classical techniques of yoga date back more than 5000 years. The practice of yoga encourages effort, intelligence, accuracy, thoroughness, commitment and dedication. The word yoga originates from the Sanskrit language and means ‘to join or yoke together’. It brings your body and mind together, and is built on three main elements – exercise, breathing and meditation.
The movements of yoga are designed to  challenge flexibility, balance, coordination and strength, increasing your body’s efficiency and overall health. Breathing techniques promote greater mind body connection, improving the  function of body and mind.
Focusing on controlled movement and breathing prepares the body and mind for meditation, with an approach to a quiet mind that allows silence and relief from everyday stress. When practiced regularly, yoga can become a powerful and sophisticated discipline for achieving physical, mental and emotional wellbeing.
There are many different varieties of yoga, each with a slightly different slant. The most popular are Hatha, Bikram, Iyengar, Yin and Vinyasa yoga.
Each yoga posture, or asana, is held for a period of time and linked with controlled breathing. Generally, a yoga session begins with gentle asanas and works up to more vigorous or challenging postures. A full yoga session should move every part of your body and should include pranayama (breath control practices), relaxation and meditation.
The different postures or asanas include:
The practice of yoga asanas develops strength and flexibility, while soothing your nerves and calming your mind. The asanas affect the muscles, joints and skin, and the whole body – glands, nerves, internal organs, bones, respiration and the brain. The physical building blocks of yoga are the posture and the breath.
Health benefits of yoga include:
Yoga is taught in classes, catering for beginners through to advanced participants. It is non-competitive and suitable for anyone, regardless of your age or fitness level. Your yoga teacher should carefully guide and observe you, and modify postures when necessary.
An asana should never cause pain. If you experience pain or discomfort, ease back on the stretch or don’t do it at all. It is important to keep within your physical limits.
If you are a male over 45 years of age or a female over 55 years of age, haven’t exercised for a long time or have a pre-existing medical condition, you should check with your preferred general practitioner or another suitably qualified professional before starting any new or regular exercise routine.
Pre-exercise  screeningExternal Link   is used to identify people with medical conditions or contraindications that may put them at a higher risk of experiencing an adverse event during physical activity. It is a tool to help decide if the potential benefits of exercise outweigh the risks for you and whether you should seek further guidance from an allied health or medical professional.

The normal worries of everyday life can usually be controlled or 'switched off'. Worrying can be constructive if it helps you to work out possible solutions to a problem. However, some people are troubled by excessive worry and anxiety that seems difficult to control. This type of excessive worrying is known as generalised anxiety disorder (GAD). 
Worries associated with GAD are distressing, last a long time and may appear for no apparent reason. GAD is characterised by a feeling of apprehension and constant irrational worrying about potential threats to the person and their loved ones.
The main feature of GAD is excessive anxiety and worry, occurring more days than not for at least six months. Worries are often about a variety of minor issues and events that are unlikely to occur. Generally, the worries are future oriented -– about what might happen rather than what is happening. Even when there is no cause for alarm, a person with GAD might worry about health, finances, family issues, and work or study performance.
Generalised anxiety disorder affects about five per cent of the population and onset can be at an early age – one third of people with GAD experience onset in childhood or adolescence. GAD may occur following a stressful life event or a period of high stress. It is more likely to develop if a person is predisposed to high anxiety due to a combination of genetic factors and environmental influences.
Generalised anxiety disorder is often chronic (ongoing), but may have only a moderate impact on a person’s ability to function in daily life and so can often remain undetected and undiagnosed. There are various self-help strategies you can use to reduce your tendency to worry. You can also seek professional treatment.
People with generalised anxiety disorder experience several mental, emotional and physical symptoms, including:
Biological, psychological, social and cultural factors all appear to influence the development of GAD. The contributing factors may include:
Self-help strategies that can help a person to control or reduce their worrying include:
Structured problem solving is a way of turning fruitless worrying into strategies to find solutions. It is best to practise first on small worries or problems, and limit yourself to working on one problem at a time. As you become proficient at the technique, you can tackle larger, more complex problems. Write down all the steps as you work through them. The steps of structured problem solving include:
Many people who experience excessive worry report that they don't know how to relax. Regular practice of a relaxation technique, such as progressive muscle relaxation (systematic tensing and relaxing of the various muscle groups), can help to reduce the physical symptoms of anxiety.
Mindfulness meditation, the practice of focusing our attention on the present moment, involves both physical relaxation and creating a calm and peaceful state of mind. During meditation, the brain's activity – when mapped by a device called an electroencephalograph (EEG) – is different to any other measurable state of consciousness, including sleep. The brain waves produced are called alpha waves, and this brain state has been found to promote relaxation of the entire nervous system. 
Scientific studies show that the regular practice of meditation can be a powerful tool in anxiety management. 
Exercise is proving to be an effective strategy to help people manage symptoms of depression and anxiety. There are various theories to explain how exercise can lift a person's mood. These include:
Health professionals who can help treat GAD include psychologists, psychiatrists and general practitioners (doctors).
Treatments that are helpful for alleviating GAD include a variety of psychological therapies and medications. A combination of cognitive behaviour therapy, anxiety management techniques and improving physical wellness has been found to be successful in bringing generalised anxiety disorder under the person's control.
Medication is sometimes used to relieve anxiety symptoms; however, if it is used, it is generally only recommended as a short-term measure. 
Don't hesitate to seek professional advice if your self-help strategies don't seem to be working for you.

Trauma can have a serious effect on babies and toddlers. Many people wrongly believe that babies do not notice or remember traumatic events. In fact, anything that affects older children and adults in a family can also affect a baby, but they may not be able to show their reactions directly, as older children can.
Traumatic and life-threatening events may include incidents such as car accidents, bushfires, sudden illness, traumatic death in the family, crime, abuse or violence in the community. 
Trauma can seriously disrupt important aspects of child development that occur before the age of three years. These may include relationship and bonding with parents, as well as foundational development in the areas of language, mobility, physical and social skills and managing emotions. Providing support to help the family rebuild a safe, secure and nurturing home will help the baby or toddler recover. 
Babies and toddlers are very helpless and depend on their family and parents for a sense of safety and security. They need emotional nurturing, through loving and reassuring interactions, and help with coping in an ongoing and consistent way. This is how babies and toddlers develop and grow.
During their early months and years, children are very sensitive to:
If any of these things are happening, it is important to think about the effect on the baby. If the family or primary carer is affected, the baby is probably also affected.
When babies or toddlers are exposed to life-threatening or traumatic events, they become very scared – just like anybody else. Some common reactions may include:
Structure, predictability and nurturing are key to helping a baby or toddler who has been traumatised. There are a number of things parents and carers can do to help their baby or toddler cope with and recover from trauma: 
The first and second year of a child’s life has lots of ups and downs. Development may slow down for a while and then move forward again. It can sometimes be difficult to work out if this is just one of those times or whether something more serious is happening. 
It may help to seek professional advice if: 
There is increasing evidence to suggest that the younger a child, the more serious the post-traumatic problems. Actively seeking help and advice early on to support recovery is important. 
If at any time you are worried about your mental health or the mental health of a loved one, call Lifeline on 13 11 14.

Blood pressure is the pressure of blood on the walls of your arteries as your heart  pumps blood around your body. Blood pressure does not stay the same all the time. It changes to meet your body’s needs and it is normal for your blood pressure to go up and down throughout the day. It is affected by various factors, including body position, breathing, emotional state, exercise and sleep.If blood pressure remains high over a long period of time, it can lead to a heart attack, stroke, heart failure or kidney disease. 
The medical name for high blood pressure is hypertension.  The medical name for low blood pressure is hypotension.
Blood pressure is recorded as two numbers, such as 120/80. The larger number is the pressure in the arteries as the heart pumps out blood during each beat. This is called the systolic blood pressure.The lower number is the pressure as the heart relaxes before the next beat. This is called the diastolic blood pressure. Both are measured in units called millimetres of mercury (mmHg).
It is best to measure blood pressure when you are relaxed and sitting. Blood pressure is usually measured with an inflatable pressure cuff that wraps around your upper arm. This cuff is part of a machine called a sphygmomanometer.
Your blood pressure changes to meet your body’s needs. If a reading is high, your doctor may measure your blood pressure again on several separate occasions before diagnosing high blood pressure.
Your doctor may recommend that you have your blood pressure recorded at home with a monitoring device. This is also known as 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and it involves measuring your blood pressure at regular intervals (usually every 20-30 minutes), while you do your usual activities including sleeping.  Your doctor will organise this service if required.  
If you are considering buying a blood pressure device to use at home, it is best to speak to your doctor to see if this is needed. If so, then buy a device that measures blood pressure accurately. See this list of devices that have been approved by the British and Irish Hypertension Society.  
What is considered a healthy blood pressure varies from person to person. Your doctor will explain what your ideal blood pressure is based on a range of factors, including your overall health.The following numbers should only be used as a guide:
High blood pressure usually does not have any symptoms. You can have high blood pressure and feel perfectly well. The only way to find out if your blood pressure is high is to have it checked regularly by your doctor.
Low blood pressure can be  a problem if it has a negative impact on your body or affects the way you feel. Low blood pressure can make people feel dizzy or faint. See you doctor if you think you have low blood pressure.
Get your blood pressure checked every two years if your blood pressure is in the healthy range and:
Your doctor can also check your blood pressure during routine visits.
You should have your blood pressure checked more frequently (such as every 12 months or as directed by your doctor) if:
You can also have your blood pressure checked as part of a Heart Health Check. A Heart Health Check is a 20-minute check up with your doctor (GP) which is subsidised by Medicare. You are eligible for a Heart Health Check if you: 
As part of a Heart Health check, your doctor will: 
Your doctor will then use this information to calculate your risk of having a heart attack or stroke over the next five years. Your doctor will then discuss how you can lower your risk. 
If your blood pressure remains high, it can lead to serious conditions like a heart attack, heart failure, stroke or kidney disease. Your risk will depend on any other modifiable or non-modifiable risk factors you might have. 
Modifiable risk factors are factors that you can change. Non-modifiable risk factors are factors you can’t change. 
Heart attack and stroke risk factors that you can change include:
There are also some health conditions that increase risk:
Risk factors you can’t change include:
Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander Peoples and people from some ethnic backgrounds (South Asian, Middle Eastern, Māori or Pacific Islander) are also at increased risk.
Your doctor will support you to make changes to manage your blood pressure: 
Your doctor may also recommend you take medicines to manage your blood pressure. Even if you need to take medicines, it’s still important for make healthy changes too. 
Tobacco smoking is a major risk factor for heart disease and can increase blood pressure. Stopping smoking is one of the best things you can do to help manage your blood pressure. Every cigarette that you don’t smoke is doing you good. 
The most effective way to stop smoking is with a combination of:
There is also evidence that e-cigarettes can increase heart rate and blood pressure, which may increase the risk of heart disease. If you are ready to quit smoking or thinking about quitting smoking, talk to your doctor about ways to help you give up smoking. You can also call the  QuitlineExternal Link   (Tel. 13 78 48) 
The Heart Foundation recommends people follow a heart-healthy eating pattern. Heart-healthy eating is  importantExternal Link   for managing blood pressure and reducing the risk of heart  diseaseExternal Link  .
This way of eating is naturally low in unhealthy fats, salt and added sugar. It’s rich in wholegrains, fibre, antioxidants and healthy fats.
Check out the Heart Foundation  websiteExternal Link   for a range of resources to help you follow a heart-healthy eating pattern.
For individualised nutrition advice, you can also speak to an Accredited Practising  DietitianExternal Link  .  
Salt is a mineral made up of sodium and chloride. It’s the sodium in salt that is bad for your health. When looking at food labels on groceries, it is the sodium that is listed. 
Reducing the amount of salt  (sodium)External Link   you eat can help to manage your blood pressure. The Heart Foundation recommends five grams of salt (about a teaspoon) as a daily maximum. 
In addition to following a heart-healthy eating pattern, follow these top tips to reduce your salt intake: 
Being physically active is a great way to manage your blood pressure and reduce your risk of heart disease. 
All types of physical activity count.  Walking, cycling, swimming and yoga are all great for your health. It’s important to do activities you enjoy as you are more likely to keep active if you are having fun. It is recommended that you:
Walking is a great activity for heart health and managing blood pressure. Getting involved with a Heart Foundation Walking group is a fun and social way to be active.  You can also register for a free Personal Walking Plan. Visit Heart Foundation Walking for more  informationExternal Link  . 
Alcohol isn’t a necessary or recommended part of a heart-healthy eating pattern.  Drinking alcohol can increase blood pressure and the risk of heart disease.  
If you don’t drink alcohol, don’t start. If you do drink alcohol, the Heart Foundation recommends following the National Health and Medical Research Council’s (NHMRC) recommended levels of alcohol consumption: 
Speak to your doctor for advice and support to cut down on alcohol. 
 MedicinesExternal Link   are available to lower and manage high blood pressure. Your doctor may call them ‘antihypertensives’, (which basically means ‘anti’ – against and ‘hypertensive’ – high blood pressure). 
Medicines for high blood pressure can include: 
These medicines help maintain a healthy blood pressure to improve the flow of oxygen and blood around the body. Some help the heart to pump more easily and efficiently. 
Once you start to take medicines to manage your blood pressure, you may need to take them for the rest of your life. However, the dose of these medicines may change over time. If your doctor recommends you take blood pressure medicines, it’s still important to make healthy choices when it comes to your diet and physical activity. 
If you need to take medicines, your doctor will advise you on the correct type and dose. Two or more different medicines are often needed to manage blood pressure.
Make sure you take your medicines regularly. Some things that may help you remember to take them include:
Take any blood pressure medicine exactly as prescribed. Don’t stop or change your medicine unless your doctor advises you to.

Agoraphobia is a type of anxiety disorder. A person with agoraphobia is afraid to leave environments they know or consider to be safe. In severe cases, a person with agoraphobia considers their home to be the only safe environment. They may avoid leaving their home for days, months or even years.
Translated, agoraphobia means ‘fear of the marketplace’. Generally, busy public places (such as supermarkets, shopping centres, trams, trains, planes and airports) are feared the most. However, any public place – even a quiet church or an empty park – may seem threatening to a person suffering from agoraphobia. 
Typically, agoraphobia often starts off as a mild anxiety about a particular event, place or situation that escalates over time into a generalised fear of being in public. Mental health experts believe that the root of agoraphobia is fear of the physical and mental sensations of anxiety and, often, of panic or of losing control or embarrassing oneself. A person with agoraphobia is unwilling to visit ‘unsafe’ places because they’re afraid that doing so will trigger anxiety or a panic attack. 
The symptoms and signs of agoraphobia may include: 
Agoraphobia usually begins with a stressful event – for example, a person loses a job or a relationship ends. They feel distressed and limit their contact with the outside world (this is called ‘avoidance behaviour’). As time passes, they may consider more and more public places as ‘out of bounds’ until they are eventually confined to their home. 
In other cases, a stressful life event triggers a panic attack. Since panic attacks are so unpleasant, the person may avoid any situation or place that they think might trigger another attack until many situations and places are eventually feared and avoided. 
Untreated, agoraphobia can severely reduce a person’s quality of life. For example: 
Diagnosis is usually based on the person’s reported symptoms. However, the doctor may run a series of medical tests to make sure the symptoms are not caused by an underlying physical illness. The doctor may suggest referral to a psychologist or psychiatrist for further evaluation and treatment.

A traumatic experience is any event in life that causes a threat to our safety and potentially places our own life or the lives of others at risk. As a result, a person experiences high levels of emotional, psychological, and physical distress that temporarily disrupts their ability to function normally in day to day life.
Teenagers who experience a distressing or frightening event are often concerned by these strong emotions. Despite the fact that these reactions usually subside as a part of the body’s natural healing and recovery process, it is important for parents or carers to understand the ways in which a teenager manages distress and trauma so they can support and help the young person.
Teenagers can also be deeply upset by local, national or international tragedies, or trauma that affects their friends. Your teenager will handle trauma differently to younger children or adults. A younger child depends directly on their family, whereas many teenagers look to their peer group for support. In order to help them, parents need to understand the ways in which teenagers manage distress.
Every young person is different, but common symptoms of distress include:
Any event that places your life or the lives of others at risk results in your body going into a state of heightened arousal. This is an ‘emergency mode’ that involves a series of internal alarms being turned on. Emergency mode gives people the capacity to access a lot of energy in a short period of time to maximise the chance of survival.
Most people only stay in emergency mode for a short period of time or until the immediate threat has passed. However, being in emergency mode uses up vital energy supplies and this is why people often feel tired afterwards.
The normal healing and recovery process involves your body coming down out of a state of heightened arousal. In other words, your internal alarms turn off, the high levels of energy subside, and your body re-sets itself to a normal state of balance and equilibrium. Typically, this should occur within about one month of the event.
The transition from child to adult can be rocky. A teenager may lose the confidence they had as a child. Unlike a younger child, a teenager isn’t as dependent on their family. A younger child realises they couldn’t survive without their parents, whereas a teenager is more aware of their ability to make it ‘on their own’.
For teenagers, friends and peer groups are very important. By comparing themselves with their friends, a teenager gets a sense of how ‘normal’ they are. Teenagers tend to seesaw between independence and insecurity after a distressing event. This sort of contradictory behaviour can be confusing to the teenager and to the parents trying to help them.
A teenager may be deeply upset by the event, but despite this, they may not want to share their feelings with their parents.
Some of the reasons for this include that they:
Family problems can occur if:
There are a number of strategies that can be put in place to help a teenager resolve traumatic reactions.
Some common suggestions include:
Traumatic stress can cause very strong reactions in some teenagers and may become chronic (ongoing).
Signs that you should seek professional help include:
If at any time you are worried about your mental health or the mental health of a loved one, call Lifeline on 13 11 14.

Pilates (or the Pilates method) is a series of exercises inspired by calisthenics, yoga and ballet. Pilates promotes mobility and strength of all the major muscle groups in the body in a balanced fashion, whilst also having a key focus on the deep core muscles. It improves posture, flexibility, strength, balance and body awareness.
Always consult your doctor before embarking on any new fitness program, especially if you have a pre-existing medical condition or have not exercised in a long time.
In the 1920s, physical trainer Joseph Pilates recognised modern lifestyles and their impacts on balance, posture and overall physical health. Inspired by his own complications as a child and by different forms of movement, he worked hard to improve his body. With great success he became stronger, more flexible and overall healthier. Following this, he introduced this way of movement what was to be later called Pilates into America as a way to help injured athletes and dancers safely return to exercise and maintain their fitness. Since then, Pilates has been adapted to suit people in the general community.
Pilates can be an aerobic and non-aerobic form of exercise. It requires concentration and focus, because you move your body through precise ranges of motion.  It requires concentration in finding a centre point to control your body through movement. Each exercise has a prescribed placement, rhythm and breathing pattern.
In Pilates, your muscles are rarely worked to the point of exhaustion, so there is not always sweating or straining, just intense concentration. The workout consists of a variety of exercise sequences that are performed in low repetitions, usually five to ten times, over a session of 45 to 90 minutes. Floor based exercises performed on a mat and specialised equipment for resistance are often used.
The Pilates method is taught to suit each person and exercises are regularly re-evaluated to ensure they are appropriate for that person. Due to the individual attention, this method can suit everybody from elite athletes to people with limited mobility, pregnant women and people with low fitness levels.
Classes are held in specialised Pilates studios, physiotherapy clinics or at your local leisure facility or community centre.
The health benefits of Pilates include:
Pilates caters for everyone, from beginner to advanced. You can perform exercises using your own body weight, or with the help of various pieces of equipment.
A typical Pilates workout includes a number of exercises and stretches. Each exercise is performed with attention to correct breathing techniques and abdominal muscle control. To gain the maximum benefit, you should do Pilates at least two or three times per week. You may notice postural improvements after 10 to 20 sessions.
Pilates and Yoga are often thought to be one in the same, however Pilates traditionally focuses more on control of movement and muscular endurance as opposed to yoga which connects the body to the mind through flow of movement.
The two basic forms of Pilates are:
Some forms of Pilates include weights (such as dumbbells) and other types of small equipment that offer resistance to the muscles.
Pilates consists of moving through a slow, sustained series of exercises using abdominal control and proper breathing. The quality of each posture is more important than the number of repetitions or how energetically you can move.
Books, online videos and other resources are available, however seek instruction from a qualified Pilates professional teacher/instructor or physiotherapist to get the best results.
Although Pilates is a low-impact form of exercise, certain people should seek professional advice before embarking on a new program, including:

        Traumatic events usually happen quickly and chaotically. A near-miss experience occurs when you are involved in a traumatic event where you think you will die or be badly hurt, but are not. This can have a deep psychological impact, sometimes with lasting effects
      

        People with post-traumatic stress disorder often experience feelings of panic or extreme fear, which may resemble what was felt during the traumatic event.
      

        If you have survived a traumatic event, whether you were injured or not, it's important to recognise that trauma also causes emotional harm. Survival is often associated with complex emotional reactions that cause distress and make it hard to resume everyday life after the event. These are known as ‘survivor reactions’.
      

        Some survivors of torture and trauma live with their memories for years, or even for the rest of their lives.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic condition that results from a malfunctioning immune system.
Your immune system is designed to identify foreign bodies (such as bacteria and viruses) and attack them to keep you healthy. However, in the case of rheumatoid arthritis, your immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue in and around your joints, causing ongoing inflammation and pain.
Joints are places where bones meet. Bones, muscles, ligaments and tendons all work together so that you can bend, twist, stretch and move about.
The ends of your bones are covered in a thin layer of cartilage. It acts like a slippery cushion absorbing shock and helping your joint move smoothly.
The joint is wrapped inside a tough capsule filled with synovial fluid. This fluid lubricates and nourishes the cartilage and other structures in the joint. 
When you have rheumatoid arthritis:
The most common symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis include:
Less common symptoms may include weight loss, inflammation of other body parts (such as the lungs or eyes) or rheumatoid nodules (fleshy lumps below the elbows or on hands or feet).
Rheumatoid arthritis can occur at any age, but usually appears between the ages of 30 and 60. It affects women more often than men.
The course and severity of rheumatoid arthritis varies from person to person. Symptoms may change from day to day.
At times your symptoms (such as pain, fatigue and inflammation) may become more intense. This is a flare, or flare-up. Flares are unpredictable and can seem to come out of nowhere. 
We don’t know what causes the immune system to malfunction and attack the joints, but it appears that your genes may play a role. Other factors such as hormones, infection (by an unknown bacteria or virus), emotional distress or environmental triggers (such as cigarette smoke or pollutants) may be involved. 
If you’re experiencing joint pain and inflammation, it’s important that you discuss your symptoms with your doctor. Getting a diagnosis as soon as possible means that treatment can start quickly. Early treatment will help you to control the inflammation, manage pain more effectively and minimise the risk of long-term joint damage and disability.
If you’re diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis or suspected of having the condition, you may be referred to a medical specialist known as a rheumatologist for further investigations and medical treatment.
While there’s no cure for rheumatoid arthritis, there are many strategies to help manage the condition and its symptoms so you can continue to lead a healthy and active life. It’s helpful to understand the nature of your condition and build good relationships with your doctor, rheumatologist and healthcare professionals.
Some of the medications you may take include:
Depending on your particular symptoms, and how much pain and inflammation you have, you may take one medication or a combination of different medications. 
There are other things you can do to manage your rheumatoid arthritis: 
Surgery may be necessary in some cases when joint deterioration and pain are severe or there’s a risk of losing overall function.

For children, as for adults, a distressing or frightening experience can challenge their sense of security and the predictability of their world. Such events can include life-threatening car accidents, bushfires, floods, sudden illness, traumatic death in the family, crime, abuse or violence.
Children’s responses to these experiences depend on their age and stage of development, and the impact on their parents or significant others including siblings, friends or carers.
It’s a natural reaction to want to shield children from harsh realities. However, keeping a child ‘in the dark’ doesn’t protect them from the emotional impact of a distressing or frightening event. It may even make it worse for them as children are keen observers and will realise that something is wrong, even if no one in the family talks to them about it.
If a child hasn’t been given the facts they need, they will fill in the blanks from previous knowledge or experience or from their imagination. Since children are naturally self-centred, they may assume the tragedy was somehow their fault, for example, a child may think that God sent a bushfire to punish them for disobedience. In some cases, the child’s construction of the events may be far scarier than what actually happened.
Every child reacts differently and typical reactions change with age. Your child may not react the way you expect. Depending on their age and stage, they may not have acquired the skills to articulate their thoughts and feelings to those around them. Depending on their level of distress, they may not know how to communicate and find words to express their thoughts and feelings to those around them. Sometimes, distress reactions surface weeks or even months after the event.
Common reactions include:
Children look to their parents and carers to gain understanding of a situation and find appropriate ways to deal with it. General suggestions include:
It may help to seek professional advice if:
If at any time you are worried about your mental health or the mental health of a loved one, call Lifeline on 13 11 14.

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a set of reactions that can develop in people who have experienced or witnessed a traumatic event that threatens their life or safety (or of others around them). This could be a car or other serious accident, physical or sexual assault, war-related events or torture, or a natural disaster such as bushfire or flood.
In the first days and weeks after a traumatic event, people often experience heightened arousal, alertness, looking for danger and being on guard.  These reactions often alternate with numbness and detachment.  It also brings constant memories of the event and feelings it may happen again. It also evokes strong feelings of fear, sadness, guilt, anger, or grief. Generally these reactions and feelings will resolve on their own over the next few weeks, however if the reactions and distress continue, it may mean that the person has is at risk for developing PTSD or another mental health condition.
Anyone can develop PTSD following a traumatic event, but people are at greater risk if:
A person with PTSD has four main types of difficulties:
A health practitioner may diagnose PTSD if a person has symptoms in each of these four areas for a month or more, which lead to significant distress or impacts on their ability to work and study, their relationships and day-to-day life.
People with PTSD can also have what are termed ‘dissociative experiences’, which are frequently described as:
Older children and teenagers experience similar problems to adults when they develop PTSD. Younger children can express distress in a different way. For example, they may re-live the traumatic event through repetitive play rather than having unwanted memories of the event during the day. Many children have frightening dreams without recognisable content rather than nightmares that replay the traumatic event. Children may also lose interest in play, become socially withdrawn, or have extreme temper tantrums.
About one third of children who experience a traumatic event will develop PTSD.
Other problems that can develop alongside PTSD include anxiety or depression, defiant behaviour, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and in teenagers and young adults, suicidal thoughts and alcohol or drug use.
PTSD can affect a person’s ability to work, perform day-to-day activities or relate to their family and friends. A person with PTSD can often seem uninterested or distant as they try not to think or feel in order to block out painful memories. They may stop them from participating in family life or ignore offers of help. This can lead to loved ones feeling shut out.
It is important to remember that these behaviours are part of the problem. People with PTSD need the support of family and friends but may not understand what is happening to them or think that they need help.
When PTSD goes on for some time, it is not unusual for people to experience other mental health problems at the same time. In fact, up to 80 per cent of people who have long-standing PTSD develop additional problems - most commonly depression, anxiety, and alcohol or other substance misuse. These may have developed directly in response to the traumatic event or as a result of the effects of having PTSD.
People commonly use alcohol or other drugs to blunt the emotional pain that they are experiencing. Alcohol and drugs may help block out painful memories in the short term, but they can get in the way of a successful recovery and cause other serious problems.
A person who has experienced a traumatic event should seek professional help if they:
Some of the signs that a problem may be developing are:
Many people experience some of the symptoms of PTSD in the first two weeks after a traumatic event, but most recover with the help of family and friends. For this reason, for a diagnosis of PTSD is not made until a month after the event. Treatment does not usually start for at least two or more weeks after a traumatic experience. However if the event is very distressing and emotions and reactions are intense, it is advisable to seek help as early as possible to understand what is happening and help recovery to start.
It is important during the first few days and weeks after a traumatic event to get whatever help is needed. This may include accessing information, people and resources that can help you to recover. Support from family and friends may be all that is needed. Otherwise, a doctor is the best place to start to get further help.
If you are still experiencing problems after two weeks, a doctor or mental health professional may discuss starting treatment. Effective treatments are available. Most involve psychological treatment such as counselling to understand what is happening and to develop ways of managing reactions, but medication can also be helpful. Generally, it’s best to start with psychological treatment rather than use medication as the first and only solution to the problem.
The cornerstone of treatment for PTSD involves confronting the traumatic memory and working through thoughts and beliefs associated with the experience as part of a safe relationship with a trained person.
Trauma-focussed treatments can:
For children and teenagers who are struggling to recover after a traumatic event, the recommended treatment is trauma-focussed cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). This treatment involves:

Exercise programs are popular. There are gyms and other fitness providers with many different types of classes, exercise routines and equipment, catering to a wide range of people.
If you are unfamiliar with what is involved, starting an exercise program can be challenging. Talk to an AUSactive registered  professionaExternal Link  l to find out about the many options available.
An exercise program that is tailored specifically to your needs is a great way to stay physically and mentally fit. It also provides additional benefits such as: 
Before you get started, if you are new to exercise or are coming back from a long period of inactivity, it will help if you: 
You probably have some idea of how fit you are. However, assessing and recording baseline (starting) fitness scores can give you benchmarks (points of comparison) against which to measure your progress. It’s valuable to assess your progress on a regular basis, for example each month. Remembering progression with some goals may be achieved in shorter or longer periods of time.
Before you start your new exercise program, record:
(Note: Some medications affect your heart rate. If you are taking any medications that do so, consult a health professional and consider another way of measuring your exertion levels, such as the Borg scale.) The adult pre-exercise screening tool contains exercise intensity guidelines, including exertion and other descriptive measures. 
Consult an exercise or health professional to help you interpret this information or to do a fitness assessment for you, and work out what sort of program is best for you.
Consulting an exercise professional when designing your fitness program can help you reduce injury and customise your program to your needs, especially if you are new to exercise or you haven’t done any physical activity for a while. Points to keep in mind when designing your program include:
Be sure to pick shoes designed for the activity you have in mind, as well as for your foot type. If you’re planning to buy gym equipment, choose something that’s practical, enjoyable and easy to use.
When you are ready to start getting active:
Remember to:
For more information, visit our fact sheet Physical activity – how to get started.
Assess your progress six weeks after you start your program (by measuring the same parameters as you did to record your baseline fitness) and then every eight to 12 weeks. You may need to adjust the time, intensity and type of exercise you do to continue improving. On the other hand, you may be pleasantly surprised to find that you’re exercising just the right amount to meet your fitness goals.
If you start to lose motivation, set new goals or try a new activity. Exercising with a friend or taking a class at a local fitness centre may help.

By donating eggs, sperm or embryos, you are giving someone the chance to start their own family.
Donating your eggs, sperm or embryos is an entirely altruistic act, one of the most generous gifts that can help others fulfil their dream of starting a family.
It is also a decision that needs to be made carefully and there are important considerations donors should be aware of.
Victorian legislation sets out certain requirements for donating eggs, sperm or embryos. Both public and private fertility clinics may also have particular expectations for potential donors based on clinical considerations. These aim to protect the health and welfare of donors, recipients and any donor-conceived children.
Speak to a Victorian fertility clinic that provides donor services to find out their specific eligibility criteria.
When donating eggs and sperm, a fertility specialist will tailor your treatment based on your individual needs and circumstances. 
Clinics may also have different requirements and expectations, but the following are some common processes you can expect:
It is important to note that in Victoria, donors cannot be paid for their donations.
In some cases, you may already have access to an egg that has been fertilised with sperm – that is, an embryo.
If you are sure you no longer need or want your embryo(s), you may choose to donate it.
Here are some ways you can do this:
For more information on what to expect, speak to your GP or fertility specialist.
You can also learn more about becoming a donor on the Victorian Assisted Reproductive Treatment Authority (VARTA)  websiteExternal Link  .

It outlines rights and obligations for donors, recipients of donations and any donor-conceived children. This includes their rights and obligations in relation to access to information.
It is important you think about your contact preferences before you donate. For example, who you’d like to access your identifying information, and how you’d like to be contacted if someone (such as the recipient of your egg or sperm donation) wishes to connect with you.
Learn more about becoming an egg or sperm donor in Victoria on the VARTA  websiteExternal Link  .
Victoria is host to Australia’s first public egg and sperm bank. This is operated by the Royal Women’s Hospital and is an extension of Victoria’s public fertility care service.

A joint is the part of the body where two or more bones meet to allow movement. Every bone in the body – except for the hyoid bone in the throat – meets up with at least one other bone at a joint. The shape of a joint depends on its function. A joint is also known as an articulation. 
Generally speaking, the more movement that is possible through a joint, the higher the risk of injury. This is because greater range of movement reduces the strength of the joint.
Joints are described by how much movement they allow. The three broad classes of joints include:
The six types of freely movable joint include:
To achieve movement, the joint may:
Joints are held together and supported by tough bands of connective tissue called ligaments. Smooth cartilage prevents friction as the bones move against one another. In freely movable joints, the entire joint is enclosed inside a membrane filled with lubricating synovial fluid, which helps to provide extra cushioning against impact. 
Muscles are attached to bones with thick, tough bands of connective tissue called tendons. Where tendons lie close to bone, tiny sacs called bursae sit between the tendon and the bone to reduce friction. A bursa is filled with synovial fluid.
Common causes of joint pain include:

Your heart is a vital organ. It is a muscle that pumps blood to all parts of your body. The blood pumped by your heart provides your body with the oxygen and nutrients it needs to function.
Your heart is about the size of a clenched fist, and weighs between 300 and 450 g. It lies in the middle of your chest, behind and slightly to the left of your breastbone. 
If you are of average body weight and size, your body contains about five litres of blood, all of which passes through your heart every minute or so. When necessary, such as during exercise, your heart can pump up to four times that amount per minute.
Your heart has a right and left side separated by a wall called the septum. On each side of the wall, there is a small collecting chamber called an ‘atrium’, which leads into a large pumping chamber called a ‘ventricle’. There are four chambers: the left atrium and right atrium (upper chambers), and the left ventricle and right ventricle (lower chambers).
The right side of your heart collects blood on its return from the rest of your body. The blood entering the right side of your heart is low in oxygen. Your heart pumps the blood from the right side of your heart to your lungs so it can receive more oxygen. 
Once it has received oxygen, the blood returns directly to the left side of your heart, which then pumps it out again to all parts of your body through an artery called the aorta. 
Blood pressure refers to the amount of force the pumping blood exerts on arterial walls.
Each atrium is connected to its ventricle by a one-way valve. The valve on the right side of the heart is called the tricuspid valve, while the valve on the left side is called the mitral valve. 
The familiar 'lub-dub' sound of the heartbeat is caused by the rhythmic closing of the heart valves as blood is pumped in and out of the chambers. 
The heart rate is regulated by a special cluster of cells in the right atrium, called the sinus node. The sinus node  prompts the upper chambers to contract first. Then, an electrical impulse is sent to a second cluster of cells (the atrioventricular node), which is found between the upper and lower chambers of the heart. The electrical impulse causes the lower chambers to contract. At rest, your heart beats approximately 60 to 100 times a minute.
The blood vessels of the heart include:
There are many different types of heart conditions. Some common heart conditions include:
‘Heart disease’ is a broad term for different conditions affecting the heart. 
Different heart conditions can have different symptoms. 
It’s important to be aware of the following symptoms, which can be a warning sign of a medical emergency, including a heart attack:
If your symptoms last more than 10 minutes, are severe or getting worse, call triple zero (000) immediately for an ambulance.

Puberty is the time when all your major organs and body systems mature. At the end of puberty, you are sexually and reproductively mature. The growth and development that occurs during puberty is prompted by changes in the levels of certain hormones in your body. 
Hormonal changes begin in the mid-primary school years, but puberty properly starts at around 10 years for girls and 11 years for boys. Everyone is different – you may start puberty earlier or later. Girls typically start puberty well before boys.
As puberty advances, both boys and girls experience many emotional changes; for many, it is a time of choosing different ways of engaging with family, friends and teachers.
The physical changes that happen for girls around puberty include:  
The physical changes that happen for boys around puberty include:
Emotional changes sometimes occur before the physical changes of puberty. Many young people want to take greater control of their lives as they pass through puberty. You may find that you are:
Emotional challenges that may emerge at this time include:
These emotional changes are an important part of you working out your own moral values and identity. 
Throughout puberty you may want to gain further independence, but not yet feel ready to give up the support of your parents or carers. This can mean you sometimes feels like an adult and sometimes feels like a child. This is normal.
Exploring, taking risks and sometimes acting impulsively are also normal during this time. Your parents or carers may worry when you want to go out on your own and act independently, because they are concerned about your safety and wellbeing. Your growing wish for independence can lead to arguments with parents or carers wanting to keep you safe. It generally works best if you discuss and work through these issues together.
Being a parent of a child going through puberty is sometimes not easy. It is important to maintain good communication and be available if troubles happen. It is also important to maintain clear rules and expectations. Allowing greater independence needs to go hand in glove with setting and communicating clear limits. For more information, read Parenting children through puberty.

Preschool age children can be seriously affected by trauma, just like older children and adults. Life-threatening events such as car accidents, bushfires, sudden illness, traumatic death in the family, crime, abuse or violence in the community can cause trauma. A preschooler’s language is still developing, and they may not have the words to communicate what they feel, so it is important to look for other clues in their behaviour and the way they play to understand if the trauma has had an effect. 
Preschoolers do not understand what has gone wrong but are very sensitive to things not being right. A child’s response to a distressing or frightening experience will depend on their age, stage of development and personality, as well as the impact of the crisis on their parents, primary carers or significant others. Your child may not react in the ways you expect. 
Children’s responses to trauma can vary, but common reactions include: 
There are a number of things you can do to help your preschool age child during times of trauma. 
Children of preschool age develop skills at different rates and some skills are learnt earlier than others. Trauma can slow things down or get in the way of new things being learnt. It can also cause marked changes in behaviour.
Parents or care-givers should seek help if:
If at any time you are worried about your mental health or the mental health of a loved one, call Lifeline on 13 11 14.

Arthritis is a general term that refers to over 150 different conditions. The accurate term for this group of conditions is musculoskeletal conditions, as they affect the muscles, bones and joints.
While there is no special diet or ‘miracle food’ that can cure arthritis and other musculoskeletal conditions, everyone can benefit from eating a healthy, well-balanced diet to maintain general good health.
Some conditions may be helped by making changes to your diet. For example:
Your body works best when you eat a wide range of healthy foods. Most people find that they feel better if they eat a balanced and varied diet to get all the vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and other nutrients their body needs. 
Try to eat a Mediterranean-style diet which includes fish, pulses, nuts, olive oil and plenty of fruit and vegetables. Eating a balanced diet and having an adequate fluid intake can also help provide you with better energy levels, help to maintain your weight, and give you a greater sense of wellbeing, which may improve your symptoms. 
Always seek the advice of your doctor or dietitian before changing your diet. You may be restricting your food intake unnecessarily or taking too much of certain products (such as mineral supplements) that may have no impact on your condition at all. Some supplements may also interact with your medication. 
If you‘re overweight or obese, the extra load on your joints may be making your arthritis symptoms worse, especially if the affected joints include your hips, knees, feet or spine. There’s also a clear link between being overweight and an increased risk of developing osteoarthritis.
To lose excess weight you need to be active, but this can be challenging for people with arthritis due to pain or stiffness. See your doctor, dietitian or health professional for information and advice. 
Foods that contain omega-3 fats have been found to help reduce the inflammation associated with some forms of arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis. These effects are modest compared with medication, but they don’t have side effects, and may also have other health benefits, such as reduced risk of heart disease.
Foods rich in omega-3 fats include: 
Don’t confuse fish oils with fish liver oils (such as cod liver oil and halibut liver oil). Fish liver oils also contain vitamin A. Large amounts of vitamin A can cause serious side effects. Ask your doctor before taking any supplements, to make sure you’re taking the correct dosage.
Gout occurs when uric acid, a normal waste product, builds up in your bloodstream and forms crystals in a joint, such as the big toe, causing inflammation and pain.
It’s believed that lowering uric acid levels through small changes in your diet may help reduce the chance of future gout attacks. These changes include:
Your doctor or dietitian can help guide you in making healthy changes to your diet. 
Be aware that dietary changes alone are not enough to address the underlying cause of gout – too much uric acid in your blood. You also need to continue to take any medication your doctor has prescribed to manage your gout.
The supplements glucosamine and chondroitin are popular – yet evidence about their effectiveness in treating arthritis is very limited.
Some studies show that glucosamine sulphate and chondroitin, taken either separately or in combination, may improve pain slightly for people with osteoarthritis. There is no evidence that these supplements are effective for any other forms of arthritis.
Glucosamine and chondroitin may interact with other medication, including warfarin, and should only be taken after consultation with your doctor.
People with gout may find that avoiding certain foods, in combination with gout medication, may prevent a gout attack. 
However, there’s no substantial scientific evidence that other forms of arthritis can be improved or alleviated by avoiding particular foods.
There is no conclusive evidence that the following foods trigger or aggravate the symptoms associated with arthritis and other musculoskeletal conditions:
These foods all contain important nutrients and avoiding them may cause other health problems. 
People who have an intolerance to certain foods have found that excluding them from their diet can make them feel better overall. However, it’s unclear how this affects arthritis symptoms. If you’re thinking of excluding foods from your diet, speak with a dietitian to make sure you’re not eliminating important nutrients. 
Tips for managing your diet if you have arthritis include:

Panic disorder is not the same as anxiety or a single panic attack. Most people experience anxiety and up to 40 per cent of us have a panic attack at some stage during our lives. People who have recurring panic attacks are more likely to have panic disorder, and this affects one to two per cent of people.  Agoraphobia may be classified separately from panic disorder, because some people have the symptoms of agoraphobia without experiencing a panic attack. However, some people will have panic attacks along with their other symptoms of agoraphobia.
Not everyone who has a panic attack has a panic disorder, but having recurring panic attacks is a symptom of panic disorder. Some people with agoraphobia have panic attacks, but you can have agoraphobia without having panic attacks.
Panic attacks occur suddenly. Symptoms can vary for different people, but they tend to hit their peak within 10 minutes. 
A panic attack typically has four or more of:
Rather than having just a single panic attack, if you have panic disorder you will experience several recurring panic attacks. 
Symptoms of panic disorder include:
Agoraphobia is often thought of as fear of open spaces, but it is more than this. Agoraphobia is fear or anxiety of being in situations where you feel you cannot escape. 
These include being:
The exact causes of panic disorder or agoraphobia are not known, but there are several risk factors, including:
Healthcare professionals who can diagnose a mental health condition include your GP, a psychiatrist and some psychologists. Each of these professionals offers different types of services, so the first step is to visit your GP to speak about your concerns. They can then refer you to other healthcare professionals, if required. 
Your doctor will do a physical examination and may take blood samples for testing. A diagnosis of panic disorder or agoraphobia will also involve your healthcare professional asking you questions about your symptoms and feelings, so they can understand your problem. If you experience panic attacks, they will want to know when, where and how often you have them. 
They will also ask about your medical history. Some healthcare professionals may ask you to fill in some forms, which will also ask you a range of questions about your symptoms, moods and panic attacks. This will help the healthcare professional to understand and diagnose your problem, so that you can get the best treatment possible.
To fit the criteria for a diagnosis of panic disorder, you will need to have experienced the symptoms of panic disorder. Your doctor will also need to confirm that medication, substances or other physical or mental health conditions are not causing your symptoms.
To fit the criteria for a diagnosis of agoraphobia, you will need to have experienced the symptoms of agoraphobia and some additional signs. These include:
Having early treatment is important for recovery from panic disorder or agoraphobia. Treatment can be very effective in reducing the number of panic attacks for most people. The first step is to visit your doctor and get professional help. 
The treatment for panic disorder or agoraphobia is medication or psychological therapies. You can also make a number of changes in your life to support your treatment.
Psychological therapies, which involve talking with a therapist, can be an effective form of treatment. The most common form used for panic disorder and agoraphobia is cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT). 
CBT can be short-term and helps you to learn:
When choosing a healthcare professional to treat your panic disorder or agoraphobia, do your research and check the therapist’s qualifications and experience. The booklet, Panic disorder and agoraphobia. Australian treatment guide for consumers and carers, from the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of  PsychiatristsExternal Link   provides information about the types of qualifications to look for.
Treatment for panic disorder or agoraphobia can include either antidepressant or anti-anxiety medication. Some antidepressant medication can also be used to treat anxiety.
Other ways you can support your own mental wellbeing include:

Yoga brings the body and mind together and is built on three main elements – movement, breathing and meditation. Yoga has many physical and mental health benefits including improved posture, flexibility, strength, balance and body awareness.
Always consult your doctor before embarking on any new fitness program, especially if you have a pre-existing medical condition or have not exercised in a long time.
Pilates and yoga are often thought to be one in the same, however Pilates traditionally focuses more on control of movement and muscular endurance as opposed to yoga which connects the body to the mind through flow of movement.
Yoga is an ancient Indian philosophy that dates back thousands of years. It was designed as a path to spiritual enlightenment, but in modern times, the physical aspects of yoga have found huge popularity as a gentle form of exercise and stress management. There are many different varieties of yoga, but each one essentially relies on structured poses (asanas) practiced with breath awareness.
Researchers have discovered that the regular practice of yoga may produce many health benefits, including increased cardiovascular fitness, improved muscular strength and normalisation of blood pressure. Yoga is a renowned antidote to stress and promotes improved sleeping patterns. Over time, those who practice yoga report lower levels of stress, and increased feelings of happiness and wellbeing. This is because concentrating on the postures and the breath acts as a form of meditation.
The classical techniques of yoga date back more than 5000 years. The practice of yoga encourages effort, intelligence, accuracy, thoroughness, commitment and dedication. The word yoga originates from the Sanskrit language and means ‘to join or yoke together’. It brings your body and mind together, and is built on three main elements – exercise, breathing and meditation.
The movements of yoga are designed to  challenge flexibility, balance, coordination and strength, increasing your body’s efficiency and overall health. Breathing techniques promote greater mind body connection, improving the  function of body and mind.
Focusing on controlled movement and breathing prepares the body and mind for meditation, with an approach to a quiet mind that allows silence and relief from everyday stress. When practiced regularly, yoga can become a powerful and sophisticated discipline for achieving physical, mental and emotional wellbeing.
There are many different varieties of yoga, each with a slightly different slant. The most popular are Hatha, Bikram, Iyengar, Yin and Vinyasa yoga.
Each yoga posture, or asana, is held for a period of time and linked with controlled breathing. Generally, a yoga session begins with gentle asanas and works up to more vigorous or challenging postures. A full yoga session should move every part of your body and should include pranayama (breath control practices), relaxation and meditation.
The different postures or asanas include:
The practice of yoga asanas develops strength and flexibility, while soothing your nerves and calming your mind. The asanas affect the muscles, joints and skin, and the whole body – glands, nerves, internal organs, bones, respiration and the brain. The physical building blocks of yoga are the posture and the breath.
Health benefits of yoga include:
Yoga is taught in classes, catering for beginners through to advanced participants. It is non-competitive and suitable for anyone, regardless of your age or fitness level. Your yoga teacher should carefully guide and observe you, and modify postures when necessary.
An asana should never cause pain. If you experience pain or discomfort, ease back on the stretch or don’t do it at all. It is important to keep within your physical limits.
If you are a male over 45 years of age or a female over 55 years of age, haven’t exercised for a long time or have a pre-existing medical condition, you should check with your preferred general practitioner or another suitably qualified professional before starting any new or regular exercise routine.
Pre-exercise  screeningExternal Link   is used to identify people with medical conditions or contraindications that may put them at a higher risk of experiencing an adverse event during physical activity. It is a tool to help decide if the potential benefits of exercise outweigh the risks for you and whether you should seek further guidance from an allied health or medical professional.
Yoga classes usually have 10 to 20 people, allowing for individual attention. Suggestions for getting the most out of your yoga class include:

The external female genitals are called the vulva. Symptoms of vulvar conditions commonly include a burning sensation, stinging or itching. In some cases, the vulva appears red and swollen. 
Without treatment, or with recurrent symptoms, vulvar conditions can lead to depression, anxiety, sexual problems and body image concerns. Recovery from vulvar conditions may take weeks, months or longer. 
Generally, treatment for vulvar conditions aims to ease the symptoms while healing takes place. It may speed recovery to use a number of treatments at the same time, rather than one after another.
Vulva is an umbrella term for the various parts of the external female genitals. These parts include: 
Vulvar conditions can be loosely categorised in the following ways:
Skin complaints of the vulva include: 
Vulvar infections include: 
Conditions include: 
Vulvar pain and discomfort may have a major effect on a woman’s quality of life. There are a number of other conditions that may play a role, including neurological conditions and psychosocial factors. The cause is unknown.
Management and treatment for chronic vulvar pain includes medications, pelvic floor physiotherapy, pain management therapy and, at times, simple measures such as local anaesthetic creams.
Vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) is a pre-cancerous condition of the vulva. The affected cells divide quickly and erratically, but could stay benign (non-cancerous) for many years. Vulvar cancer is classified according to its cell of origin. This can include:
Vulvar conditions can be diagnosed using a number of tests including:
Although it can feel awkward, it is important that you ask your health professional to examine your vulva if you have vulvar irritation, so that they can be sure to diagnose and treat your condition correctly.
Be guided by your GP (doctor), but general self-care suggestions include:

Polymyalgia rheumatica is a condition that causes pain and stiffness in older adults. Typical symptoms include moderate-to-severe muscle pain and stiffness, particularly affecting the neck, shoulders, thighs and hips. 
People aged 50 years and over are most commonly affected by polymyalgia rheumatica, and it becomes more common as people get older. It’s a common condition and very treatable. 
Polymyalgia rheumatica should not be confused with fibromyalgia – a condition that causes pain and muscle stiffness, but does not cause inflammation.
The symptoms of polymyalgia rheumatica usually develop over a short period of time (days/weeks) and may include:
Not everyone will experience all of these symptoms. Each person with polymyalgia rheumatica will have their own unique set of symptoms.
Polymyalgia rheumatica produces inflammation and swelling in the larger joints of the body, such as the shoulders and hips, and in the tissues around these joints.
The inflammation is due to the immune system attacking the membranes lining the joint (synovium), but the reason for this is unknown. Genetics and environmental factors (such as infections) are believed to play a role.
Risk factors for polymyalgia rheumatica include: 
Some people with polymyalgia rheumatica experience giant cell arteritis (also known as temporal arteritis). Giant cell arteritis involves painful inflammation of the blood vessels (arteries) of the skull. Symptoms include:
Seek urgent medical attention if you experience any of these symptoms. If not treated promptly, giant cell arteritis can cause damage to the arteries of the eye, which can lead to blindness. 
No single test can diagnose polymyalgia rheumatica, so your doctor will make a diagnosis based on several factors. These include your medical history, a physical examination, tests that measure the levels of inflammation markers in the blood, and tests (such as scans) to rule out other possible causes. Tests to confirm or exclude polymyalgia rheumatica may include: 
Polymyalgia rheumatica can be treated with corticosteroids, pain-relieving medications, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). 
Most people with polymyalgia rheumatica will be treated with oral corticosteroid medication. The amount prescribed will depend on your specific situation. A higher dose will be prescribed in more severe conditions and when giant cell arteritis is present. The aim of treatment for polymyalgia rheumatica is to relieve the symptoms and slowly reduce the medication dose to the lowest possible amount without the return of symptoms.Long-term use of oral corticosteroids can cause unwanted side effects, so it’s important you see your doctor regularly while taking these medications. If you have any concerns about the side effects of corticosteroids, you should discuss them with your doctor.
You may also need to take other medications from time to time to help manage your pain. Pain-relieving medications (analgesics) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can provide temporary relief of pain and stiffness.
Creams, gels and rubs can also be used. There is a large range available – from medicated gels to soothing liniments and heat rubs. Applying these to sore muscles or joints can provide temporary pain relief. 
You can do many things to help yourself if you have polymyalgia rheumatica, including:

Yoga brings the body and mind together and is built on three main elements – movement, breathing and meditation. Yoga has many physical and mental health benefits including improved posture, flexibility, strength, balance and body awareness.
Always consult your doctor before embarking on any new fitness program, especially if you have a pre-existing medical condition or have not exercised in a long time.
Pilates and yoga are often thought to be one in the same, however Pilates traditionally focuses more on control of movement and muscular endurance as opposed to yoga which connects the body to the mind through flow of movement.
Yoga is an ancient Indian philosophy that dates back thousands of years. It was designed as a path to spiritual enlightenment, but in modern times, the physical aspects of yoga have found huge popularity as a gentle form of exercise and stress management. There are many different varieties of yoga, but each one essentially relies on structured poses (asanas) practiced with breath awareness.
Researchers have discovered that the regular practice of yoga may produce many health benefits, including increased cardiovascular fitness, improved muscular strength and normalisation of blood pressure. Yoga is a renowned antidote to stress and promotes improved sleeping patterns. Over time, those who practice yoga report lower levels of stress, and increased feelings of happiness and wellbeing. This is because concentrating on the postures and the breath acts as a form of meditation.
The classical techniques of yoga date back more than 5000 years. The practice of yoga encourages effort, intelligence, accuracy, thoroughness, commitment and dedication. The word yoga originates from the Sanskrit language and means ‘to join or yoke together’. It brings your body and mind together, and is built on three main elements – exercise, breathing and meditation.
The movements of yoga are designed to  challenge flexibility, balance, coordination and strength, increasing your body’s efficiency and overall health. Breathing techniques promote greater mind body connection, improving the  function of body and mind.
Focusing on controlled movement and breathing prepares the body and mind for meditation, with an approach to a quiet mind that allows silence and relief from everyday stress. When practiced regularly, yoga can become a powerful and sophisticated discipline for achieving physical, mental and emotional wellbeing.
There are many different varieties of yoga, each with a slightly different slant. The most popular are Hatha, Bikram, Iyengar, Yin and Vinyasa yoga.
Each yoga posture, or asana, is held for a period of time and linked with controlled breathing. Generally, a yoga session begins with gentle asanas and works up to more vigorous or challenging postures. A full yoga session should move every part of your body and should include pranayama (breath control practices), relaxation and meditation.
The different postures or asanas include:
The practice of yoga asanas develops strength and flexibility, while soothing your nerves and calming your mind. The asanas affect the muscles, joints and skin, and the whole body – glands, nerves, internal organs, bones, respiration and the brain. The physical building blocks of yoga are the posture and the breath.
Health benefits of yoga include:
Yoga is taught in classes, catering for beginners through to advanced participants. It is non-competitive and suitable for anyone, regardless of your age or fitness level. Your yoga teacher should carefully guide and observe you, and modify postures when necessary.
An asana should never cause pain. If you experience pain or discomfort, ease back on the stretch or don’t do it at all. It is important to keep within your physical limits.
If you are a male over 45 years of age or a female over 55 years of age, haven’t exercised for a long time or have a pre-existing medical condition, you should check with your preferred general practitioner or another suitably qualified professional before starting any new or regular exercise routine.

It is a tool to help decide if the potential benefits of exercise outweigh the risks for you and whether you should seek further guidance from an allied health or medical professional.
Yoga classes usually have 10 to 20 people, allowing for individual attention. Suggestions for getting the most out of your yoga class include:

Stress is a process, not a diagnosis. We experience stress when there is an imbalance between the demands being made on us and our resources to cope with those demands. The level and extent of stress a person may feel depends a lot on their attitude to a particular situation. An event that may be extremely stressful for one person can be a mere hiccup in another person’s life.
You may feel under pressure to do something and fear you may fail. The more important the outcome, the more stressed you feel. You can feel stressed by external situations (too much work, children misbehaving) and by internal triggers (the way you think about external situations).
Stress is not always a bad thing. Some people thrive on stress and even need it to get things done. When the term ‘stress’ is used in a clinical sense, it refers to a situation that causes discomfort and distress for a person and can lead to other mental health problems, such as anxiety and depression.
Stress may also contribute to physical illness such as cardiovascular disease. When stress turns into a serious illness, it’s important to get professional help as soon as possible. Untreated anxiety disorders can lead to serious depression.
Stress affects us in many ways, including: 
Your attitude, personality and approach to life will influence how you respond to stress. Factors that play a part include: 
As a health problem, stress occurs when a person feels that the demands made on them exceed their ability to cope. Factors contributing to a person feeling stressed might include: 
When we feel under stress, our body kicks into high gear to deal with the threat. Our heartbeat, breathing rate and blood pressure all go up. The longer we feel stressed, the greater the demand on our body. 
The more often we are placed under stress, the more often we have to use energy to cope. There is growing evidence that stress may contribute to physical illness such as cardiovascular disease (although this link remains controversial and research is ongoing), high blood pressure, proneness to infection and chronic fatigue. 
Whatever the cause, physical diseases need appropriate medical management before any attempt is made at stress management. Discuss with your doctor how stress management may be used to support treatment of your physical symptoms.
Untreated stress can turn into a mental illness such as an anxiety disorder or depression. 
Almost everyone experiences some anxiety. This is normal. However, an anxiety disorder is different from everyday anxiety – it is more severe, can persist and may interfere with a person’s daily life. 
Common anxiety disorders include: 
A less common anxiety disorder is acute stress disorder.
Anxiety is a very treatable condition. There are many different psychological and medication options. Treatments need to be individually decided on and regularly reviewed to make sure they are effective and to minimise side effects of medications. Separately and in combination, psychotherapy and medication therapy generally produce good results.
Untreated anxiety disorders can lead to serious depression. Depressive illness is common – about 17 per cent of Australians will suffer from depression at some time in their life. 
Depression is about twice as common in women as in men. The most common time in life for people to suffer from depression is in their 40s. However, it can develop at any age. Depression is often associated with an increased incidence of suicide. The annual suicide rate for people with depression is three or four times higher than that of other psychiatric disorders.
Stress in the workplace is common and is caused by many different factors, including excessive hours, conflicts with others and feelings of isolation. The amount of stress a person experiences is often determined by whether or not they can accept that some things in life will simply never be sorted out to their satisfaction. For example, a person may feel stressed by the way they are treated by their employer or by the behaviour of a work colleague. 
Sometimes, this stress can be resolved by dealing with the particular behaviour. In many organisations, there are processes to deal with workplace problems like harassment, victimisation or unfair treatment. In many cases, the problem can be resolved if the behaviour is changed. 
However, some problems will never be fully resolved, and you may have to accept them. For example, if someone who you think is poorly qualified is given a job you felt entitled to, you may continue to feel stressed, unless you are able to let go of that grievance and move on.
The old saying ‘prevention is better than cure’ is certainly true for stress management. It will help if you: 
To deal with stress more effectively, it helps to investigate your stresses and how you react to them. Try to: 
You should see your doctor or community health centre if:

A chronic or long-term illness means having to adjust to the demands of the illness and the therapy used to treat the condition. There may be additional stresses, since chronic illness might change the way you live, see yourself and relate to others. 
Chronic illnesses are mostly characterised by:
Most chronic illnesses do not fix themselves and are generally not cured completely. Some can be immediately life-threatening, such as heart disease and stroke. Others linger over time and need intensive management, such as diabetes. Most chronic illnesses persist throughout a person’s life, but are not always the cause of death, such as arthritis.
While many illnesses can be considered chronic, there are 12 major chronic conditions that are a significant burden in terms of morbidity, mortality and healthcare costs in Australia, including: 
Chronic or long-term illness and its treatment pose special problems. You need to learn how to: 
As well as needing to find ways to deal with the stress involved with chronic illness, you also need to: 
Dealing with the stresses of chronic illness can be demanding and it puts extra pressure on you. It is important you speak to your doctor or healthcare provider about your feelings and how effectively you think you are coping with the illness and its treatment.
There is a range of ways to deal with the stress of chronic illness. These include: 
The overall aim of these strategies is to help put your illness into context and give some meaning to what is happening.
For children with a chronic illness, there are programs and opportunities for funding support attached to government, Catholic and independent sector schools. If your child has a chronic illness, speak to your school principal for help developing a health support plan and applying for programs or funding support for your child. 
Raising Children Network also has information about support groups for teenagers with chronic  illnessExternal Link  , or visit  livewireExternal Link   – the online community for teens living with a chronic illness or a disability.

        If you have survived a traumatic event, whether you were injured or not, it's important to recognise that trauma also causes emotional harm. Survival is often associated with complex emotional reactions that cause distress and make it hard to resume everyday life after the event. These are known as ‘survivor reactions’.

The optic nerve connects the eye to the brain. Our sight relies on the optic nerve transmitting information on shape, colour and pattern from the back of the eye (retina) to the brain’s visual centres. Optic neuritis is inflammation of the optic nerve that causes blurred, grey and dim vision. The symptoms can range from mild to severe, depending on the extent of the inflammation. 
Optic neuritis can occur at any age, but people in their 30s are most commonly affected. Vision improves by itself in up to 80 per cent of cases, while some degree of reduced vision is permanent for the remaining 20 per cent. A number of diseases and conditions can trigger this inflammation, including multiple sclerosis. Optic neuritis is also known as retrobulbar neuritis. 
The optic nerve is actually more than one million individual nerves bundled together. Each nerve plays a significant role in sending information from the retina to the brain. Inflammation causes affected nerves to swell, which means they cannot work properly.  
The degree of visual impairment experienced with optic neuritis depends on how many nerve fibres are inflamed – the more nerve fibres affected, the worse the symptoms. Generally, eyesight deteriorates over a few days rather than suddenly. The peak of vision loss usually happens about a week after the symptoms first appear. 
Symptoms of optic neuritis can include:
Symptoms may worsen if you are hot, for example, after playing sport or showering. 
If you have these symptoms, contact your doctor immediately. Your doctor should send you to a hospital emergency department if they suspect you have optic neuritis. 
In about 70 per cent of cases, only one eye is affected.
Some of the many conditions and diseases that can cause optic neuritis include:
Optic neuritis can be the first symptom of multiple sclerosis (MS), but this is only true for some people. Not everyone with optic neuritis will develop MS. There are many people who only have one attack of optic neuritis and do not develop any neurological problems. 
An MRI scan can assess your risk of developing MS. If there are small spots on the brain scan, your risk of developing MS is higher. It is estimated that the risk of people who have optic neuritis developing MS within 10 years is 30 to 60 per cent, depending on whether these spots are seen on the MRI scan. 
Optic nerve fibres are wrapped in myelin sheaths that help to conduct nervous system messages. With MS, the myelin sheaths become inflamed, causing plaques or lesions to appear.  
Vision problems are a common first symptom of MS. However, optic neuritis doesn’t mean that developing MS is inevitable. 
Apart from optic neuritis, other common vision problems associated with MS include:
Optic neuritis can be mistaken for a number of other eye conditions such as ischaemic optic neuropathy, so careful diagnosis is important. Tests may include:
A person may have demyelination of the optic nerve but not experience any visual symptoms. This is known as subclinical optic neuritis. The damage to the optic nerve can still be identified by certain tests, including electrical diagnostic tests and visual field examination.
Permanent damage to the optic nerve occurs in about 85 per cent of cases, but the damage does not always cause serious vision problems. In many cases, optic neuritis is short-lived and resolves by itself without treatment in around four to 12 weeks. The person’s vision improves once the inflammation subsides.  
In severe or chronic cases, intravenous corticosteroids may be used to speed along recovery. However, the use of oral corticosteroid therapy is controversial. For example, some research suggests that it may increase the risk of recurrence. Regular eye examinations are important. The person should also undergo further tests to check for the presence of MS.

The brain and spinal cord make up the central nervous system (CNS). Together, the different parts of the CNS control the activities of the mind and body.  
A brain or spinal cord tumour occurs when abnormal cells grow and form a mass or a lump. They are classified as benign or malignant. These terms are also used for tumours in other parts of the body, but with brain tumours the difference is not as clear. Both types can be serious and may need urgent treatment. 
Every year an estimated 2,000 malignant brain tumours are diagnosed in Australia and they can affect people of any age. About 100 children (aged 0–14) are diagnosed each year.  
Benign brain and spinal cord tumours are more common than malignant tumours. 
Symptoms depend on where the tumour is in the brain or spinal cord, and how quickly it is growing.  
Brain tumours can increase pressure inside the skull, which can lead to general symptoms including: 
Not everyone with these symptoms has a brain or spinal cord tumour. If you have any of these symptoms or are worried, see your doctor. 
There are more than 40 types of primary brain and spinal cord tumours. They can start in any part of the brain or spinal cord. 
Gliomas are the most common category of brain tumour. They include: 
Medulloblastoma – high-grade tumour that starts in the cerebellum, more common in children and rarer in adults. 
There are some things that can make it more likely to develop a brain or spinal cord tumour. These are called risk factors and they include: 
Family history – while it is rare for brain tumours to run in families, a fault in the genes, usually passed down from either the mother or father, can increase the risk of developing a brain tumour.  
Radiation therapy (or radiotherapy) – people who have had radiation therapy to the head, particularly to treat childhood leukaemia, may have a slightly higher risk of developing a brain tumour.  
Having these risk factors doesn’t mean you will develop a brain or spinal cord tumour. Often there is no clear reason for getting a brain or spinal cord tumour. If you are worried about your risk factors, ask your doctor for advice. 
Your doctor may do some tests to check for a brain or spinal cord tumour: 
Your doctor might ask you to have further tests. These may include: 
The grade of the cancer means how quickly a cancer might grow. Knowing the grade helps your doctor work out the best treatment plan for you. The grading system commonly used for brain tumours is from the World Health Organization  (WHO)External Link  . 
Brain and spinal cord tumours are usually given a grade from 1 to 4. 
The stage of a cancer means how far it has grown in your body. Primary brain and spinal cord tumours are not staged in this way as most don’t spread to other parts of the body.  
Ask your doctor or nurse to explain the stage of the cancer. You can also read more from Cancer Council about diagnosing brain  tumoursExternal Link  .   
When someone is diagnosed with a brain or spinal cord tumour, their doctor will give them a prognosis. A prognosis is the doctor’s opinion of how likely the cancer will spread and the chances of getting better.  
A prognosis depends on the type and stage of cancer, as well as the person’s age and general health.  
Low-grade and high-grade tumours can be life-threatening, but the prognosis may be better if the tumour is low grade, or if the surgeon is able to remove the entire tumour.  
Some brain or spinal cord tumours (particularly gliomas) can come back and may change into a higher-grade tumour.  
If you have a brain or spinal cord tumour, your doctor will talk to you about your individual situation when working out your prognosis. Every person’s experience is different, and there is support available to you. 
Treatment for a brain or spinal tumour depends on various factors and may take into account: 
Surgery in the brain or spinal cord is called neurosurgery. You may have surgery to: 
Different types of operations may be used for brain and spinal cord tumours. These include: 
Sometimes a tumour cannot be safely removed because it is too close to certain parts of the brain and surgery would cause blindness or partial paralysis. This is called an inoperable or unresectable tumour. 
Radiation therapy uses a controlled dose of radiation to kill or damage cancer cells in the area being treated. Treatment is carefully planned to do as little harm as possible to the healthy body tissue near the cancer. 
Radiation therapy is typically given after surgery and possibly along with chemotherapy (chemoradiation). 
Chemotherapy is the use of drugs to treat cancer. The drugs travel through the bloodstream and damage or destroy rapidly dividing cells such as cancer cells, while causing the least possible damage to healthy cells.  
You may have chemotherapy after surgery and possibly with radiation therapy (chemoradiation). 
 SteroidsExternal Link   are made naturally in the body, but they can also be produced artificially and used as drugs. Brain tumours and their treatments can both lead to swelling in the brain. Steroids may help to reduce this swelling, and can be given before, during and after surgery and radiation therapy.  
All cancer treatments can have side effects. Your treatment team will discuss these with you before you start treatment. Talk to your treating team about any side effects you are experiencing.  
Some side effects can be upsetting and difficult, but there is help if you need it. Call Cancer Council 13 11 20 or email askanurse@cancervic.org.au to speak with a caring cancer nurse for support. 
A brain or spinal cord tumour and its treatments can change how the mind and body work. You may experience changes to your speech, personality, memory, movement, balance or coordination. 
A range of therapies can support you in your recovery, including: 
A brain tumour or its treatment can sometimes cause seizures (fits). They can involve the whole body, or just affect one area ( such as an arm or leg). 
Seizures can often be prevented with medicines. Feeling very tired can also increase your risk of having a seizure. Try to get enough sleep and avoid daytime naps if they make sleeping at night difficult. Limiting or cutting down on alcohol may also help. 
Tumours, seizures, and certain treatments and medicines can affect the skills needed to drive safely. These can include: 
When you are first diagnosed with a brain tumour, your doctor will probably advise not to drive for a certain period. You may have a driving evaluation to check your ability to return to driving. 
In some cases, an occupational therapist can teach you driving techniques to help with weaknesses or how to make changes to your car (such as extra mirrors).  
You may also be able to drive with restrictions – such as only in daylight, only in vehicles with automatic transmission, or only short distances from home. 
It can be hard to predict how well you will recover from treatment for a brain or spinal cord tumour, and when and whether you will be able to return to work. This may also depend on the type of work you do. 
Some people find it hard to concentrate or make decisions after treatment. At least at first, it may not be safe to operate heavy machinery or take on a lot of responsibility.  
An occupational therapist can advise you about whether returning to work is safe or possible. They can also give your employer information about whether you could return to work with altered duties or on a part-time basis. In some cases, it won’t be possible to return to your former role. 
Having a brain or spinal cord tumour and treatment can change the way you feel about yourself, other people, relationships and sex. These changes can be very upsetting and hard to talk about. Your treating team are very understanding and can give you support. You can also ask for a referral to a counsellor or therapist who specialises in body image, sex and relationships. 
Advanced cancer usually means cancer that is unlikely to be cured. Some people can live for many months or years with advanced cancer. During this time palliative care services can help.  
Most people continue to have treatment for advanced cancer as part of palliative care, as it helps manage the cancer and improve their day-to-day lives.  
Many people think that palliative care is for people who are dying but palliative care is for any stage of advanced cancer. There are doctors, nurses and other people who specialise in palliative  careExternal Link  . 
Palliative care treatment may include chemotherapy, radiation therapy or another type of treatment. It can help in these ways: 
Treatment depends on: 
Ask your doctor about treatment and palliative care services that may help you.

Brain death is not the same as coma, because someone in a coma is unconscious but still alive. Brain death occurs when a critically ill patient dies sometime after being placed on life support. This situation can occur after, for example, a heart attack or stroke. The heart continues to beat while the ventilator delivers oxygen to the lungs (the heart can initiate its own beating without nerve impulses from the brain) but, despite the beating heart and warm skin, the person is dead. Since the brain has stopped working, the person won’t breathe if the ventilator is switched off.
Some of the signs of brain death include:
Brain death differs from other states of unconsciousness in important ways. For example, coma is similar to deep sleep, except that no amount of external stimuli can prompt the brain to become awake and alert. However, the person is alive and recovery is possible. Brain death is often confused with a persistent vegetative state, but these conditions are not the same either. A persistent vegetative state means the person has lost higher brain functions, but their undamaged brain stem still allows essential functions like heart rate and respiration to continue. A person in a vegetative state is alive and may recover to some degree, given time. Brain death means the person has died.
Because life support machines maintain the person’s breathing and heart rate, they are warm to the touch. This gives the illusion that the person is still alive. Family members may hold a false hope that the person is just comatose and could wake up with time or treatment. It is important for the medical staff members to fully explain that brain death is final, and that the person is dead and has no chance of ever regaining consciousness again.
In some cases, a person who is brain dead may be a candidate for organ donation. If the person was a registered organ donor, or if their family knew of their wish to be an organ donor, their death is declared, but the ventilator is left on. Drugs that help preserve the internal organs are still given. The dead person then undergoes an operation to remove viable organs such as kidneys. After the operation is complete, the ventilator is switched off. Funeral arrangements can then be made by the family.

It is normal to have strong emotional or physical reactions following a distressing event. On most occasions though, these reactions subside as part of the body’s natural healing and recovery process. Family members who experience a shared distressing event often become closer and appreciate each other more.
A traumatic experience is any event in life that causes a threat to our safety and potentially places our own life or the lives of others at risk. As a result, a person experiences high levels of emotional, psychological, and physical distress that temporarily disrupts their ability to function normally in day-to-day life.
Examples of potentially traumatic experiences include natural disasters such as a bushfire or flood, experiencing violence in the community, having a serious car accident, or being assaulted.
In a family, each member will react to the traumatic event in their own way, depending on role, age, and personality style. If family members don’t understand each other’s experience, then misunderstandings, communication breakdowns and other problems can result.
Even if you cannot understand exactly what another member is going through, being aware of common reactions and their effect on family life can help everyone cope better in the long run.
Examples of common reactions to trauma are:
Also, it is important to remember that despite the above traumatic reactions, many families look back and see that crises have actually helped them to become closer and stronger. However, don’t hesitate to seek professional help if you are uncertain or think your family is struggling to recover.
Every family is different but, generally speaking, common changes to family life soon after the event include:
It is important to remember that it is normal for people to respond in different ways to distressing events. However, sometimes people’s responses can clash. One person may withdraw and need time to themselves, while the other needs company and wants to talk about it. Although this can seem quite confusing at times, giving a person the necessary space to work through their own reaction can be extremely helpful.
With families, common reactions may include:
Family relationships may change weeks or even months after the event. Because time has passed, family members sometimes don’t realise how changes are directly linked to the event.
Every family is different but, generally speaking, common changes in the weeks or months after the event include:
Sometimes, the response to a distressing or frightening event may take a long time to show. In some cases, it may take years for problems to surface. This can happen if the person is very busy helping others or dealing with related issues, such as insurance, rebuilding, relocation, legal processes or financial problems. When things have returned to normal, their reactions may show up.  
Every family is different but, generally speaking, changes to family dynamics can include:
Some things you can do to reduce complications and support family recovery include:
Traumatic stress can cause very strong reactions in some people and may become chronic (ongoing).
You should seek professional help if you:

Smoking is a major cause of heart and blood vessel disease. 
Smoking kills more than 20,000 Australians a year (more than 55 people each day).
The coronary arteries supply the heart with oxygen and nutrients. Over time, fatty deposits ( plaque ) can build up inside the coronary arteries . This can reduce the flow of blood to the heart and increases the risk of heart attack. Smoking speeds up the clogging and narrowing of coronary arteries.
A heart attack happens when something, usually a blood clot, cuts off the flow of blood to the heart. Without oxygen and nutrients, the heart muscle begins to die. The severity of the heart attack depends on how much heart muscle is permanently damaged.
Smoking also damages other blood vessels. When the arteries supplying blood to the arms and legs are affected, this is called peripheral arterial disease which affects blood circulation. Peripheral arterial disease can lead to  blood clots, gangrene and even amputation.
Tobacco smoke contains thousands of chemicals including: 
If you smoke, your risk of: 
•    heart attack is more than twice as high as someone who does not smoke
•    coronary heart disease is significantly increased if you are a woman using the oral contraceptive pill
•    stroke is more than twice as high as someone who does not smoke
•    peripheral arterial disease, which can lead to gangrene, is increased by more than five times. 
Exposure to second-hand smoke (passive smoking) is a serious health hazard for both people who smoke  and non-smokers. Adults and children who inhale smoke from others are at increased risk of disease. 
Non-smokers living with people who smoke  have about a 30 per cent increase in the risk of heart disease. 
Exposure to second-hand smoke is especially risky for children and babies, and increases the risk of sudden unexplained death in infants (SUDI), bronchitis, pneumonia and asthma.
Within one day of quitting smoking: 
Within two to three months: 
Within one year: 
Within two to six years:

Self-harm is a term that has historically been used to cover a broad range of behaviours. It refers to deliberately causing pain or damage to your own body, and can be suicidal or non-suicidal in intent. Self-injury is a type of self-harm, and refers to deliberately causing pain or damage to your own body without suicidal intent.
Self-injury is more common in young people. Some people who self-harm may also have suicidal thoughts.
Self-harm can take on different forms and its frequency can vary from person to person – some may do it once, while others can do it for many years. It can include:
Self-harm is normally a sign that a person is feeling intense emotional pain and distress. 
There are many support options for self-harming behaviour, whether you are seeking support for yourself or someone you care about.
If you are self-harming and you are worried, try to talk to someone you trust – like a friend, family member, doctor, teacher or school counsellor. It can be hard to build up the courage to open up to someone, but remember, they care about your wellbeing. It may take time for them to understand, but it doesn’t mean they aren’t there for you. If you would rather talk to someone you don’t know, there are many options. You can:
Sometimes the distress you feel can be so overwhelming that you may have thoughts about ending your life. 
If you are thinking about suicide, don’t be afraid to ask for support – talk to someone you trust and feel comfortable with, such as a family member, friend, teacher, doctor or other health professional.
If you or someone you know is badly hurt or is at serious risk of harm, contact emergency services. Dial triple zero (000) or visit your nearest emergency department. You can also contact your doctor or mental health crisis service.You can also call:
It can be difficult to recognise whether someone is self-harming as many people who self-harm keep it a secret. Trust your instincts, especially if you think they are distressed or in trouble. Some signs may include:
People who self-harm need care, understanding and support in order to recover. Stigma from others can be damaging and may stop them from getting the support they need. According to a 2012 report by Orygen (Looking the other way: young people and self-harm), it is thought up to half the people who self-harm never seek help. 
If you think someone you know might be self-harming, it is important to try to talk to them about it, and encourage them to seek professional help. Don’t try to force them to stop, as it can make matters worse. Talking to people who self-harm about their behaviour can be safe and very helpful if done in a supportive way.
It can be difficult to approach someone who is self-harming. If you cannot do it on your own, ask someone else for help. 
 ReachOutExternal Link   and  eheadspaceExternal Link   have some helpful advice on how to start a conversation with someone who self-harms. Try the following suggestions:
If the person who is self-harming is not ready to talk about it, try another time or suggest they speak to someone who makes them feel comfortable.
Other ways to lower their distress may include:
It can be helpful to draft up a safety  planExternal Link   or learn mental health first aid so you know what to do in a crisis.
Encourage the person to seek support for themselves, or offer to help them make contact with one or more of the suggested supports.
If your child, friend or other family member is self-harming, or you think they might be, seeking support from a mental health professional is important for you too. Talk to someone you trust about what’s going on and how you feel. However, upsetting it can be to see a loved one in trouble, remember that self-harming behaviour is treatable and not everyone who self-harms is suicidal.
Self-harming is a serious behaviour – it’s a sign someone is feeling significant distress and they’re not doing it to seek attention. Usually they are deeply ashamed and go to great lengths to hide it from others. They may suffer in silence and really need support to open up about how they are feeling. 
Although self-harming behaviour can be treated, many people don’t seek support because they:
No one has to cope alone; self-harming behaviour is treatable. Support can include working on recognising triggers, learning how to manage difficult emotions and help with self-care (such as caring for wounds and learning other coping strategies).
For anyone who self-harms, just realising it is a not a long-term solution to problems is a step in the right direction. Once they make a decision to seek support, it’s important that they take it slowly and are not too hard on themselves. It can take time to break the cycle of self-harm and there may be setbacks along the way. 
It can be difficult to break away from self-harm. Treatment will include learning to find other ways to manage intense feelings. By distracting or diverting the behaviour, feelings and urges may become less intense and decrease over time.
The person who is self-harming may like to develop their own ways to distract themselves, or use some of these ideas:
People of all ages self-harm, but young people are more at risk. According to the 2015 Australian Child and Adolescent Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing, around one in ten Australian teens have self-harmed. It is more common among girls than boys, and usually starts around the ages of 12 to 14 years, just after the onset of puberty. 
Those who are at increased risk of self-harm include young people:
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young people (aged 15–24) are five times more likely to self-harm than non-Indigenous young people.
There are many reasons why people self-harm. Even for one person the motivation can vary. Some people do it as a way of expressing their distress, taking back control or escaping from situations they find troubling. Others may find it makes them ‘feel’ something when they are numb and devoid of all feelings. Some people find self-harm gives them a sense of relief. 
Whatever the reason, self-harm is normally a sign that a person is feeling intense emotional pain and distress.
For young people, many stressful things (stressors) happen all at once. Not only are they dealing with changes to their bodies, they are trying to juggle demands they didn’t have when they were younger (such as study, work, relationships, being more independent and having more responsibility).
Stressors that may increase the risk of self-harm include:
Personal factors that may increase someone’s risk of self-harm include:
Although self-harm may bring relief in the short-term, it doesn’t help the person address the reasons they are doing it in the first place. Unless the problems that are causing the self-harming behaviour are addressed, people will continue to use it as a way to cope. 
Unfortunately, self-harm can be dangerous – it can lead to serious injury and even accidental death. It can also lead to a higher risk of developing physical and mental health issues, substance misuse and unemployment.
Although most people who self-harm don’t want to die, their behaviour can become more frequent and addictive as they seek out methods to deal with overwhelming emotions. Some people who self-harm have feelings of shame, self-loathing and helplessness and may have suicidal thoughts. Many people who attempt suicide have a history of self-harm.

The nervous system helps all the parts of the body to communicate with each other. It also reacts to changes both outside and inside the body. The nervous system uses both electrical and chemical means to send and receive messages.
The basic building block of the nervous system is a nerve cell, or neurone. Neurones are shaped differently depending on where they are in the body and what role they play. All neurones have finger-like projections called dendrites and a long fibre called an axon. 
In many cases, the axon is coated by a specialised membrane called a myelin sheath. The axon feathers out and has a number of bumps on it. Each bump sits near to a dendrite from another neurone. The space between the bump and the dendrite is called a synapse. Messages jump the synapse from one neurone to the next, using special chemicals called neurotransmitters. 
Unlike other cells in the body, neurones aren’t easily replaced if they die or are damaged by infection or injury.
The brain and the spinal cord make up the central nervous system. They are wrapped in a thin lining called meninges and bathed with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).
The brain is the powerhouse of the body, even though it only makes up 2 per cent of the body’s weight. This soft, jelly-like organ has countless billions of neural cross-connections. The brain oversees the workings of the body, while its higher functions give us consciousness and personality.
The spinal cord is connected to the brain and runs the length of the body. It is protected by the bones of the spine (vertebrae). Nerves branch off from the spinal cord into the arms, legs and torso.
Nerves connect the brain and spinal cord to the peripheral nervous system, which is what nerve tissue outside of the central nervous system is called. It is made up of two main parts: the autonomic and the somatic nervous systems.
The autonomic nervous system is part of the peripheral nervous system. One of its main roles is to regulate glands and organs without any effort from our conscious minds. 
The autonomic nervous system is made up of two parts: the sympathetic and the parasympathetic. These systems act on the body in opposite ways. Together, they coordinate a multitude of adjustments required for our changing personal needs as we move through our environment. For example, the size of our pupils is adjusted automatically to allow the correct amount of light into our eyes for optimum vision, our sweat glands are turned on when we get too hot and our salivary glands produce saliva when we eat food (or even think about it!).
The somatic nervous system is also a part of the peripheral nervous system. One of its roles is to relay information from the eyes, ears, skin and muscle to the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord). It also obeys commands from the central nervous system and makes muscles contract or relax, allowing us to move.
Some common problems of the nervous system include:

Migraines can be experienced from as little as once or twice a year, or as often as two or three times a week. The pain is severe, throbbing and usually on one side of the head. A migraine attack can last from four hours to three days and is associated with a spasm of the blood vessels leading to the brain. Three times as many women (15 per cent) as men (5 per cent) suffer from migraine, and scientists believe that hormones play a large role.

A migraine headache has different symptoms from other types of headache. Migraine symptoms can include:

No one really knows what causes migraine, but it may be an inherited condition. Attacks are almost certainly triggered by a combination of factors, such as:

Migraines affect more women than men, and some researchers believe that sex hormones play a key role. For around half of these women, migraine occurs in the few days prior to or following their menstrual period. Some studies suggest that reduced levels of the sex hormone oestrogen around the time of menstruation may be to blame.



There is no cure for migraine and prevention is difficult, but treatments can help reduce the number of attacks. Migraines vary greatly from person to person and so does the treatment. 
The four treatment options available to migraine sufferers include:


In the past, pethidine was used to treat migraine. However, this is a highly addictive medication and far more effective treatments are now available. Talk to your doctor or a neurologist about the best treatment for your migraines.

Vulva is a general term that describes the external female genitals. The vulva is made up of three main parts: the labia majora (outer lips), the labia minora (smaller inner lips) and the clitoris.
Vulvar cancer is a type of cancer that affects the vulvar region. It accounts for about three per cent of all gynaecological cancers and is most commonly diagnosed in older women aged around 70 years or over. However, an increasing number of women aged 35 to 45 are being diagnosed with this form of cancer.
The most common site for vulvar cancer is the labia majora, while just one in 10 cases affect the clitoris. As the cancer grows it usually spreads to nearby body parts such as the bladder, vagina and anus. Without treatment, it can cause severe infection and pain. 
In its early stages, vulvar cancer often has no symptoms. This is because the cancer is so tiny. The progression of symptoms can include: 
Some of the risk factors for vulvar cancer include: 
Vulval intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) is a pre-cancerous condition of the vulva. It is uncommon, but appears to have a high risk of becoming cancerous if untreated. Of those women who are treated, 5 to 10 per cent may still develop vulvar cancer. 
Vulvar cancer is classified according to its cell of origin. This can include: 
Some of the methods for diagnosing vulvar cancer include: 
Treatment for vulvar cancer can include 
If vulvar cancer has been diagnosed in its later stages, the cancer may have spread to the point where a cure is no longer possible. Treatment then focuses on improving quality of life by relieving the symptoms. This is called palliative treatment.
It is possible to reduce your risk of vulvar cancer by avoiding known risk factors. 
The most significant risk reduction strategy is to avoid sexually transmissible infections (STIs). This is because some STIs (such as herpes and human papillomavirus, including genital warts) cause changes to the cells of the cervix. Women who have previously experienced changes to the cells of their cervix are at increased risk of developing VIN, which is the precursor of (comes before) vulvar cancer. 
Other risk reduction strategies include:

If you have back pain, you’re not alone. It’s a common problem experienced by many Australians. In fact 1 in 6 Australians reported back problems in 2014–15. That’s 3.7 million people.
For most people back pain comes on quickly (acute back pain), but then improves or goes away within three to six weeks. However, it is common for it to come back, with some people going on to develop more persistent pain (that lasts for more than three months).
Back pain can have a significant impact on all aspects of life including daily activities, family life, work, recreation and social activities. But there’s a lot you and your healthcare team can do to deal with back pain so you can get on with life.
To understand your back pain, it’s helpful to know a little about how your back works. 
Your back is a complex structure that provides support for your pelvis, legs, ribcage, arms and skull. The spine is made up of bones called vertebrae that are stacked together to form a loose ‘S’-shaped column. 
Each vertebra is cushioned by spongy tissue called intervertebral discs. These discs act as shock absorbers and give your spine its flexibility. Vertebrae are joined by pairs of small joints known as ‘facet’ joints. A mesh of connective tissue called ligaments holds the spine together. 
Complex layers of muscle provide structural support and allow you to move. Your spinal cord runs through the centre of the vertebral column and connects your brain to the rest of your body.  
The causes of back pain are not fully understood. Most people with back pain don’t have any significant damage to their spine. The pain comes from the muscles, ligaments and joints.
Common causes of back pain include:
Some health conditions are also linked to back pain, such as:
There are also a number of things that can make it more likely that the back pain will become persistent, such as:
In a very small number of people, back problems are caused by a serious condition such as cancer, inflammatory problems, infection, fracture or compression of the nerves in the spine. However this is rare, and your doctor will check for these causes.
Back pain may be experienced anywhere along the spine – from the neck to the buttocks. In some cases, pain may also be felt in one or both legs. It’s common to be a bit restricted in daily activities such as bending, lifting, sitting and walking while you’re experiencing back pain. 
Movement of your torso may be limited by back pain. There may also be tenderness when pressure is applied to the joints of the spine. Reduction of reflexes, strength and sensation in the legs can be a sign of nerve compression.
It’s common for people with back pain to feel distressed about their recovery. People with persistent back pain can develop fear of movement and activity (including work), worrying that it will make things worse or increase their pain. Living with persistent back pain may also lead to mood issues, such as anxiety, irritability, frustration and depression.
Your doctor or healthcare clinician will:
Your doctor may refer you for some tests if they think there may be a more serious cause for your back pain. 
However, in most cases of back pain, imaging (such as x-rays, CT or MRI scans) is not useful and is not recommended. Unnecessary tests can be expensive, and some scans involve exposure to radiation that is better avoided if the results will not help with your treatment.
A thorough examination by your doctor will decide whether more investigations are appropriate or will be helpful in developing a treatment plan that is right for you. It is important to know that many investigations show ‘changes’ to your spine that are likely to represent the normal passage of time, not ‘damage’ to your spine.
For more information about questions to ask your doctor before you get any test, treatment or procedure, visit the Choosing Wisely  AustraliaExternal Link   website.  
Most people recover quickly from acute back pain, whether they seek treatment or manage by themselves. Over-the-counter pain relievers and staying active will help lessen pain and help you get on with your life.
There is also evidence to suggest that, as part of staying active, people with back pain should make efforts to remain at work, or return to work as soon as possible. By working together with your employer and healthcare team, you are more likely to recover and avoid the problems associated with long periods of time off work.
For more persistent pain, effective treatments include:
Surgery is rarely needed for back pain unless a more serious issue or condition is causing your back pain, or if nerve compression is present.   
Almost everyone suffers back pain at some stage in their lives. Most people recover quickly with little or no treatment. The best medicine involves staying active and at work whenever possible, as well as remaining positive about recovery.
Even in people with recurrent or persistent back pain, the most effective treatments involve things you can do yourself, such as: 
In most cases, acute back pain will get better within three to six weeks.
Some people can develop recurrent or persistent back pain, however working with your healthcare team and using self-management techniques will lead to the best outcomes. It is important to understand that, even with persistent back pain, most people are able to remain at work and lead a full life.

A distressing or frightening experience can challenge your child's sense of security and the predictability of their world. Such events can include life-threatening car accidents, bushfires, floods, sudden illness, death in the family, crime, abuse and violence in the community, either experienced in person or through the media.
If you are concerned about your child in any way, or feel that you are not coping yourself, always seek professional advice. A good place to start is your family GP.
A child’s response to a distressing or frightening experience will depend on a wide range of factors including their age, stage of development and personality, and the impact of the crisis on their parents or significant others. Your child may not react in the ways you expect.
Trauma reactions may include:
Allow for a delayed reaction. Some children seem to cope well at first, but can experience reactions to the stress days, weeks or even months later.
It helps to bring all the issues out in the open. Suggestions include:
How the crisis impacts on you, and your reactions to your child’s feelings and behaviour, will have an enormous impact on your child’s ability to cope and recover. Issues to keep in mind include:

The vagina isn’t positioned vertically within the pelvis – it is angled towards the lower back. In most women, the uterus is tipped forward so that it lies over the bladder, with the top (fundus) towards the abdominal wall. Another normal variation found in some women is the upright uterus, where the fundus is straight up. 
About one quarter of women have a retroverted uterus. This means the uterus is tipped backwards so that its fundus is aimed toward the rectum. While a retroverted uterus doesn’t cause problems in most cases, some women experience symptoms including painful sex. 
Other names for retroverted uterus include tipped uterus, retroflexed uterus and uterine retrodisplacement.
Generally, a retroverted uterus does not cause any problems. If problems do occur, it will probably be because the woman has an associated disorder like endometriosis. A disorder like this could cause the following symptoms:
Some of the causes of a retroverted uterus include:
In most cases of retroverted uterus, the ovaries and fallopian tubes are tipped backwards too. This means that all of these structures can be ‘butted’ by the head of the penis during intercourse. This is known as ‘collision dyspareunia’. The woman-on-top position usually causes the most pain. It is possible for vigorous sex in this position to injure or tear the ligaments surrounding the uterus.
It is thought that a retroverted uterus has no bearing on a woman’s fertility.
In most cases, a retroverted uterus doesn’t interfere with pregnancy. After the first trimester, the expanding uterus lifts out of the pelvis and, for the remainder of the pregnancy, assumes the typical forward-tipped position. 
In a small percentage of cases, the growing uterus is ‘snagged’ on pelvic bone (usually the sacrum). This condition is known as ‘incarcerated uterus’. The symptoms usually occur somewhere between weeks 12 and 14, and can include pain and difficulties passing urine.
A retroverted uterus is diagnosed by routine pelvic examination. Sometimes, a woman may discover that she has a retroverted uterus during a Pap test. If you are experiencing symptoms such as painful sex, the first action taken by your doctor may include a range of tests to find out if other conditions are causing your retroverted uterus, such as endometriosis or fibroids.
If a retroverted uterus is causing problems, treatment options can include:

It is normal to have strong emotional or physical reactions following a distressing event. On most occasions though, these reactions subside as a part of the body’s natural healing and recovery process. There are many things you can do to help cope with and recover from such an experience.
A traumatic experience is any event in life that causes a threat to our safety and potentially places our own life or the lives of others at risk. As a result, a person experiences high levels of emotional, psychological, and physical distress that temporarily disrupts their ability to function normally in day-to-day life.
Examples of potentially traumatic experiences include:
The way a person reacts to trauma depends on the type and severity of the traumatic event, whether the person has any previous relevant experience or training, if they are active or helpless, the amount of available support following the incident, other current stressors in the person’s life, their personality, natural levels of resilience, and any previous traumatic experiences.  
Common reactions include:  
These reactions are normal, and in most cases, they subside as a part of the body’s natural healing and recovery process over the next few weeks.  
Mental reactions to trauma include:
Emotional reactions to trauma can include:  
Traumatic experiences can result in physical reactions including:
Common behavioural reactions to trauma include:
Once the distressing event is over, you may find yourself trying to make sense of the event. This can include thinking about how and why it happened, how and why you were involved, why you feel the way you do, whether feelings you are having indicate what kind of person you are, whether the experience has changed your view on life, and how.  
There are a number of strategies that can help a person resolve traumatic reactions.  
Any event that places a person’s own life or the lives of others at risk results in the human body going into a state of heightened arousal. This is like an ‘emergency mode’ that involves a series of internal alarms being turned on. Emergency mode gives people a lot of energy in a short period of time to maximise the chance of survival.  
Most people only stay in emergency mode for a short period of time or until the immediate threat has passed, but sometimes people keep going into it afterwards when unexpected things happen. Being in emergency mode uses up vital energy supplies and this is why people often feel tired afterwards.  
The normal healing and recovery process involves the body coming down out of heightened arousal. The internal alarms can turn off, the high levels of energy subside, and the body can re-set itself to a normal state of balance and equilibrium. Typically, this should occur within approximately one month of the event.  
Trauma experts Dr Rob Gordon and Anne Leadbeater share valuable insights on coping with trauma, helping others who have experienced trauma, and seeking different ways to move forward.
Listen to our trauma and recovery  podcastExternal Link  
Traumatic stress can cause very strong reactions in some people and may become chronic (ongoing). You should seek professional help if you:  
After a distressing event, some people find their reactions are serious and do not gradually subside after a month. Severe, prolonged reactions can be disabling, and can affect a person’s relationships with family and friends as well their capacity to work. Such reactions might indicate post-traumatic stress disorder. In this condition, the impact of the event continues to cause high levels of stress.  
If you think you might be experiencing PTSD, you should seek help from a health professional.

        Respect, consideration, recognition and support are some of the principles that guide how government departments, local councils and government-funded services work with carers and people who are being cared for.
      

        There are laws that set out how healthcare professionals can collect and store your health information and when they are allowed to share it.
      

        Informed consent means that a person understands their condition and any proposed medical treatment and carers can help with the decision-making process.
      

        If you are unhappy with the way a disability service has treated you, you have the right to complain and to have your concerns addressed.
      

        Carers have the right to make a complaint on behalf of a person in their care to a healthcare professional, service or regulatory body.
      

        Carer roles can change, for example, from part-time to full-time care and back as a person’s care needs change.
      

        You and your carers should expect clear communication about medical issues and treatment options and costs in hospital in a way that you can understand.
      

        More than 700,000 Victorians are a personal carer for a family member or friend who is older with care needs, has a disability or has a mental health or other chronic health condition. 
      

        The term ‘carer’ can refer to paid and unpaid, professional and ‘lay’ carers.  
      

        Even though you are caring for someone else, it is important that you remember to take care of yourself.
      

        Care in culturally and linguistically diverse communities may be supported by extended family networks.
      

        Being a carer for someone with a mental illness can be emotionally and physically demanding, but it can also be a rewarding experience.
      

        Foster care is temporary care of children up to 18 years by trained, assessed and accredited foster carers.
      

        As a foster carer, you are providing a safe, supportive home for a child or young person who can’t live with their family of origin. You may face challenges that other parents don’t have to confront.
      

        Even though you are caring for someone else, it is important that you remember to take care of yourself.
      

        As circumstances change, it is important to continually assess what services and home assistance will be most helpful.
      

        Sexuality is a key part of human nature. Expressing sexuality in satisfying ways is important for everyone, including people with a disability. Some people with disability may need additional support, education or services to enjoy healthy sexuality and relationships.
      

        Carers often organise appointments and treatments for the person they are caring for and help with medicines. 
      

        When caring for a loved one with a terminal illness, it is important to look after your own mental health and wellbeing so that you will have the energy and strength required for your role as carer.
      

        Sexuality is a key part of human nature. Expressing sexuality in satisfying ways is important for everyone, including people with a disability. Some people with disability may need additional support, education or services to enjoy healthy sexuality and relationships.
      

         Ask a doctor and research health information when making a health decision. This will include the cost, timing and regularity of medical treatment.
      

        You can appoint someone to be your medical power of attorney, also known as ‘enduring power of attorney (medical treatment)’, to make medical decisions on your behalf when, in certain circumstances, you can’t.
      

        There will be times during your care role when you will need to adjust your role as the circumstances of both you and the person you care for change.
      

        Whether you are receiving care at home or living in a residential aged care home, you have the right to be treated with respect and dignity at all times, and receive high-quality care and support. 
      

        Community services offer information, advice, practical support, financial help or a combination of services.

        Look after your emotional needs so you can continue your care role, be healthy and well and enjoy life as much as possible.
      

        The Australian and Victorian Governments offer carer support services to people who provide care to someone with a disability, mental illness, medical condition or older person with care needs.
      

        If you are a carer, for example of a person with a disability or mental illness, or recovering from an accident or illness or an older person with care needs, you need to look after yourself or the demands may wear you down.

Fear is a natural human emotion, and it is something that everyone experiences in their lifetime. What matters most is how you fight your fears, and whether you let them affect your life. 
You may not call your feeling ‘fear’. You might call it stress, worry or panic, but often, when we use these words, we are talking about the same emotion.
When you feel fear, you can experience three types of symptoms:
The good news is there are lots of ways to help manage your fears. And lots of places to find help. Let’s start by exploring the differences between healthy and unhealthy fears.  
Fear is programmed into your nervous system, and it works, instinctively, from when you are a baby. It gives you the survival instincts you need to keep yourself safe when you feel like you are in danger.
Some fears are healthy. If you see a poisonous snake in your back yard, and your fear prompts you to run back into the house and close the door, that is a healthy fear. The feeling of fear is natural and helps keep you safe.
But other fears are unhealthy and unnecessary. Sometimes, your fear makes you more cautious than you really need to be. For example, the fear of meeting new people. It may be intimidating, but meeting new people does not pose any real threat to your safety. This fear is unhealthy because it stops you doing things you might otherwise enjoy. 
Feelings of fear, worry or stress can be upsetting, but they usually pass when the cause of your stress is gone. You won’t need too much help fighting your fears here, because they don’t last long.
Anxiety is a more serious condition. It is common to be anxious in a high pressure situation; for example, before you make a speech or sit an exam. You might also experience anxiety after a stressful event, such as an accident. 
An anxiety disorder is different, because those anxious feelings are there even when there is no obvious cause. 
If you experience feelings of anxiety that are severe or happen often, or if they affect your day-to-day life, you could talk to your GP. You might have an anxiety disorder. Many people suffer from anxiety for years before seeking help, but your GP can discuss a variety of treatment options with you if you’ve had these feelings for a month or more. 
A phobia is an irrational fear of a certain object or situation. Someone with a phobia can experience intense anxiety when they are exposed to this particular object or situation – or sometimes if they just think about it.
Common phobias include:
There are several ways you can try to fight your fears. If you have mild symptoms, your GP might suggest you try changing your lifestyle first. Simple changes, like exercising  regularlyExternal Link  , can reduce your stress levels. So can eating healthy meals, getting enough sleep, and reducing or avoiding stimulants like caffeine and alcohol. 
If your symptoms are more serious, your GP may suggest seeing a therapist for treatment such as cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT). CBT is a type of psychological therapy that can help you to change unhelpful thoughts and behaviours that contribute to your anxiety. 
CBT involves working with a therapist to look at your patterns of thinking (cognition) and acting (behaviour) that are making you more likely to have problems with anxiety, or are keeping you from improving once you feel anxious. 
When you recognise those patterns, you can make changes to replace unhelpful patterns with new ones that help reduce your anxiety and help you to cope. CBT is a common treatment for anxiety disorders.
Strategies you might employ with your therapist as part of CBT include:
E-therapies (also known as online therapies or computer-aided psychological therapy) can be an effective option for people with mild to moderate anxiety. Most e-therapies follow the same principles as CBT or behaviour therapy. They teach you how to identify and change patterns of thinking and behaviour that contribute to anxiety or stop you from overcoming your anxiety. 
You can work through an e-therapy program yourself, although many provide some kind of support – via the telephone, email, text or instant messaging. E-therapies are easy to access and can be done from home. And you don’t have to visit a doctor first. 
You can also use exposure  therapyExternal Link  , where you learn to fight a fear by giving yourself the chance to learn about, and gradually get used to, whatever it is that you are afraid of. 
Some people find it useful to develop a fear ladder – identify your fear, set a goal and then work out the incremental steps to achieve it. For example, if you are afraid of flying, your fear ladder could look like this:
Whatever your fear, anxiety or phobia, there is always help at hand. Your GP can help you get started on a treatment plan to fight your fears.

Anxiety disorders can affect a person’s ability to work, study and participate in other activities. Recovery is possible with appropriate treatment. There are different types of anxiety disorders. These include:
Anxiety disorders can be distressing and debilitating. They may contribute to loss of educational and employment opportunities and difficulties in family and social relationships. Recovery is possible with appropriate treatment such as exposure therapy, attention training, and a range of anxiety management techniques that can help you manage your symptoms. You can learn the following strategies yourself (using books or taking courses, for example) or you can consult with a trained professional.
Some of the management options for anxiety disorders include:
The old adage ‘knowledge is power’ applies here – learning all about anxiety is central to recovery. For example, education includes examining the physiology of the ‘flight-or-fight’ response, which is the body’s way to deal with impending danger. For people with anxiety disorders, this response is inappropriately triggered by situations that are generally harmless. Education is an important way to promote control over symptoms.
When feeling anxious, a person can spend a significant amount of time caught up in anxiety-provoking thoughts.  MindfulnessExternal Link   guides us to bring our attention back to the present moment and unhook from thoughts that may be unhelpful.Mindfulness is becoming more and more popular as people start to realise how beneficial it is for a number of issues. There are many resources available to support you to develop a mindfulness  practiceExternal Link  .
A person who feels anxious most of the time has trouble relaxing, but knowing how to release muscle tension can be a helpful strategy. Relaxation techniques include:
The physical symptoms of anxiety may be triggered by  hyperventilationExternal Link  , which raises oxygen levels and reduces the amount of carbon dioxide in the blood. Carbon dioxide assists in the regulation of the body’s reaction to anxiety and panic. It can be helpful for a person who suffers from anxiety to learn how to breathe from their diaphragm, rather than their chest, to safeguard against hyperventilation. The key is allowing your belly to expand as you breathe in. You can make sure you are breathing correctly by placing one hand on your lower abdomen and the other on your chest. Correct breathing means your abdomen moves, rather than your chest. It also helps to slow your breathing while feeling anxious. Some people can find abdominal breathing challenging. There are many other breathing techniques that you can try. You can also try to hold your breath for a few seconds. This helps to boost carbon dioxide levels in the blood.
Cognitive therapy focuses on changing patterns of thinking and beliefs that are associated with, and trigger, anxiety. For example, a person with a social phobia may make their anxiety worse by negative thoughts such as, ‘Everyone thinks I’m boring’. The basis of cognitive therapy is that beliefs trigger thoughts, which then trigger feelings and produce behaviours. For example, let’s say you believe (perhaps unconsciously) that you must be liked by everyone in order to feel worthwhile. If someone turns away from you in mid-conversation, you may think, ‘This person hates me’, which makes you feel anxious. Cognitive therapy strategies include rational ‘self-talk’, reality testing, attention training, cognitive challenging and cognitive restructuring. This includes monitoring your self-talk, challenging unhelpful fears and beliefs, and testing out the reality of negative thoughts.
A major component of behaviour therapy is exposure. Exposure therapy involves deliberately confronting your fears in order to desensitise yourself. Exposure allows you to train yourself to redefine the danger or fear aspect of the situation or trigger. The steps of exposure therapy may include:
The mineral magnesium helps muscle tissue to relax, and a magnesium deficiency can contribute to anxiety, depression and insomnia. Inadequate intake of vitamin B and calcium can also exacerbate anxiety symptoms. Make sure your daily diet includes foods such as wholegrain cereals, leafy green vegetables and low-fat dairy products. Nicotine, caffeine and stimulant drugs (such as those that contain caffeine) trigger your adrenal glands to release adrenaline, which is one of the main stress chemicals. These are best avoided. Other foods to avoid include salt and artificial additives, such as preservatives. Choose fresh, unprocessed foods whenever possible.
The physical symptoms of anxiety are caused by the ‘flight-or-fight’ response, which floods the body with adrenaline and other stress chemicals. Exercise burns up stress chemicals and promotes relaxation. Physical activity is another helpful way to manage anxiety. Aim to do some physical activity at least three to four times every week, and vary your activities to avoid boredom.
Being  assertiveExternal Link   means communicating your needs, wants, feelings, beliefs and opinions to others in a direct and honest manner without intentionally hurting anyone’s feelings. A person with an anxiety disorder may have trouble being assertive because they are afraid of conflict or believe they have no right to speak up. However, relating passively to others lowers self-confidence and reinforces anxiety. Learning to behave assertively is central to developing a stronger self-esteem.
People with anxiety disorder often have low self-esteem. Feeling worthless can make the anxiety worse in many ways. It can trigger a passive style of interacting with others and foster a fear of being judged harshly. Low self-esteem may also be related to the impact of the anxiety disorder on your life. These problems may include:
The good news is you can take steps to learn about and improve your  self-esteemExternal Link  . Community support organisations and counselling may help you to cope with these problems. 
Some people with anxiety disorders are ‘worriers’, who fret about a problem rather than actively solve it. Learning how to break down a problem into its various components – and then decide on a course of action – is a valuable skill that can help manage generalised anxiety and depression. This is known as structured problem  solvingExternal Link  .
It is important that medications are seen as a short-term measure, rather than the solution to anxiety disorders. Research studies have shown that psychological therapies, such as cognitive behaviour therapy, are much more effective than medications in managing anxiety disorders in the long term. Your doctor may prescribe a brief course of tranquillisers or antidepressants to help you deal with your symptoms while other treatment options are given a chance to take effect. 
Support groups allow people with anxiety to meet in comfort and safety, and give and receive support. They also provide the opportunity to learn more about anxiety and to develop social networks.

Multiple births are more common than they were in the past, due to the advancing average age of mothers and the associated rise in assisted reproductive techniques, in particular the use of fertility drugs. There are two types of twins – identical (monozygotic) and fraternal (dizygotic). 
To form identical twins, one fertilised egg (ovum) splits and develops two babies with exactly the same genetic information. This differs from fraternal twins, where two eggs (ova) are fertilised by two sperm and produce two genetically unique children, who are no more alike than individual siblings born at different times.
Twins are more or less equally likely to be female or male. Contrary to popular belief, the incidence of twins doesn’t skip generations.
Some women are more likely than others to give birth to twins. The factors that increase the odds include:
Hormones secreted by the ovaries, and a small gland in the brain called the pituitary, control the menstrual cycle. The average cycle is around 28 days. After a menstrual period, rising levels of the hormone oestrogen help to thicken the lining of the womb (the endometrium) and release an egg from one of the ovaries (ovulation). 
If the egg is fertilised on its journey down the fallopian tube, it lodges in the thickened womb lining, starts dividing and evolves into an embryo.
Around one in three sets of twins is identical. This occurs because the fertilised egg divides in two while it is still a tiny collection of cells. The self-contained halves then develop into two babies, with exactly the same genetic information. 
Twins conceived from one egg and one sperm are called identical or ‘monozygotic’ (one-cell) twins. The biological mechanisms that prompt the single fertilised egg to split in two remain a mystery. 
Approximately one quarter of identical twins are mirror images of each other, which means the right side of one child matches the left side of their twin.
Around two in three sets of twins are fraternal. Two separate eggs (ova) are fertilised by two separate sperm, resulting in fraternal or ‘dizygotic’ (two-cell) twins. These babies will be no more alike than siblings born at separate times. The babies can be either the same sex or different sexes.
Some researchers believe there may be a third type of twin, although medical opinion is still divided. It is proposed that the egg splits in two, and each half is then fertilised by a different sperm. This theory is an attempt to explain why some fraternal twins look identical.
The normal length of gestation for a single baby is around 40 weeks. However, gestation for twins, either identical or fraternal, is usually around 38 weeks or earlier, with 68 per cent of multiple births being born prematurely and admitted to Special Care Nursery or Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. This shorter time is due to the increased demands on the mother’s body, and the inability of the babies to receive all the nutrients they need in utero. 
Since twins are usually premature, they are more likely to have lower birth weights. Prematurity is associated with increased risk of a number of disorders, including jaundice.
When you are identified as having a multiple pregnancy, it is likely that more frequent check-ups with your care team will be scheduled due to the higher risks associated with multiple pregnancies.
It is recommended to speak to your GP if you notice the stress of a multiple birth pregnancy impacting your mental health. Pregnant women with multiples are more prone to pregnancy complications, including:
It is also important to know whether your twins are sharing a placenta, as sharing a placenta also means sharing the blood supply from the mother. If the sharing of the blood supply is unequal, this can lead to complications. For this reason, women carrying twins sharing a placenta will need to have more frequent antenatal check-ups.
Twins sharing an inner membrane (which means they share the amniotic sac) carry an even higher risk of complications, as there is the potential for their umbilical cords to become tangled and to cut off their blood supply. In this case the pregnancy is monitored even more closely, and it may be recommended that your twins be delivered earlier.
It is advised that women carrying twins give birth in hospital, rather than at home. The babies can be delivered vaginally, but caesarean section delivery may be considered a better alternative in some circumstances.
During twin pregnancies, the mother might experience severe morning sickness, diabetes in pregnancy, high blood pressure, or early onset of labour due to waters breaking prematurely, leading to preterm delivery of their babies.
For the babies, increased risks include being born prematurely, and birth complications due to a shared placenta or blood vessels, and uterine restriction.
It is difficult to tell if twins are identical or fraternal at birth. Some identical twins may be born with individual sets of membranes, which may lead to the mistaken assumption that the babies are fraternal. 
One way to tell the difference is to have the twins DNA-tested. Identical twins share the same genetic information, while fraternal twins share around half. The test can be done with a sample of cheek cells (collected painlessly) or blood group examinations.
While the distinction may not seem important if you have two (or more) healthy babies, it can be useful to know for health reasons because identical twins have a high likelihood of experiencing the same illnesses or having the same health condition. Identical twins are also compatible for organ transplantation, should it be required.
