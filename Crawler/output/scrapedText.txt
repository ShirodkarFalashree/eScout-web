Computer networking is like having a group of friends who all have phones and can call or text each other. In computer networking, instead of phones, we have computers and instead of phone lines, we use cables, Wi-Fi, or other methods to connect them. When computers are connected to a network, they can share information and resources, like files, printers, and internet connections. This allows them to communicate with each other quickly and easily, just like friends talking on their phones.
A computer network consists of various kinds of nodes. Servers, networking hardware, personal computers, and other specialized or general-purpose hosts can all be nodes in a computer network. Hostnames and network addresses are used to identify them. In this article, we are going to discuss computer networking in detail.
What is a Computer Network?
A computer network is a system that connects many independent computers to share information (data) and resources. The integration of computers and other different devices allows users to communicate more easily. A computer network is a collection of two or more computer systems that are linked together. A network connection can be established using either 
cable
 or 
wireless media.
 Hardware and software are used to connect computers and tools in any network.
What Do Computer Networks Do?
Computer Networks are one of the important aspects of Computer Science. In the early days, it is used for data transmission on
 telephone lines
 and had a very limited use, but nowadays, it is used in a variety of places.
Computer Networks help in providing better connectivity that helps nowadays. Modern computer networks have the following functionality:
Computer Networks help in operating virtually
Computer Networks integrate on a large scale
Computer Networks respond very quickly in case of conditions change
Computer Networks help in providing data security
In simple terms, a computer network is made up of two main parts: devices (called nodes) and connections (called links). The links connect the devices to each other. The rules for how these connections send information are called communication protocols. The starting and ending points of these communications are often called ports
Basic hardware interconnecting network nodes, such as Network Interface Cards (NICs), Bridges, Hubs, Switches, and Routers, are used in all networks. In addition, a mechanism for connecting these building parts is necessary, which is usually galvanic cable and optical cable are less popular (“optical fiber”)The following are the network devices :
A network card, often known as a network adapter or 
NIC
 (network interface card), is computer hardware that enables computers to communicate via a network. It offers physical access to networking media and, in many cases, 
MAC
 addresses serve as a low-level addressing scheme. Each
 network interface
 card has a distinct identifier. This is stored on a chip that is attached to the card.
A 
repeater
 is an electrical device that receives a signal, cleans it of unwanted noise, regenerates it, and retransmits it at a higher power level or to the opposite side of an obstruction, allowing the signal to travel greater distances without degradation. In the majority of twisted pair Ethernet networks, Repeaters are necessary for cable lengths longer than 100 meters in some systems. Repeaters are based on physics.
A 
hub
 is a device that joins together many twisted pairs or fiber optic Ethernet devices to give the illusion of a formation of a single network segment. The device can be visualized as a multiport repeater. A network hub is a relatively simple broadcast device. Any packet entering any port is regenerated and 
broadcast
 out on all other ports, and hubs do not control any of the traffic that passes through them. Packet collisions occur as a result of every packet being sent out through all other ports, substantially impeding the smooth flow of communication.
Bridges
 broadcast data to all the ports but not to the one that received the transmission. Bridges, on the other hand, learn which MAC addresses are reachable through specific ports rather than copying messages to all ports as hubs do. Once a port and an address are associated, the bridge will only transport traffic from that address to that port.
A switch differs from a hub in that it only forwards frames to the ports that are participating in the communication, rather than all of the ports that are connected. The collision domain is broken by a switch, yet the switch depicts itself as a broadcast domain. Frame-forwarding decisions are made by switches based on MAC addresses.
Routers are networking devices that use headers and forwarding tables to find the optimal way to forward data packets between networks. A router is a computer networking device that links two or more computer networks and selectively exchanges data packets between them. A router can use address information in each data packet to determine if the source and destination are on the same network or if the data packet has to be transported between networks. When numerous routers are deployed in a wide collection of interconnected networks, the routers share target system addresses so that each router can develop a table displaying the preferred pathways between any two systems on the associated networks.
To provide system compatibility, a 
gateway
 may contain devices such as protocol translators, impedance-matching devices, rate converters, fault isolators, or signal translators. It also necessitates the development of administrative procedures that are acceptable to both networks. By completing the necessary protocol conversions, a protocol translation/mapping gateway joins networks that use distinct network protocol technologies.
Links are the ways information travels between devices, and they can be of two types:
Communication done in a wired medium
 Copper wire, twisted pair, or fiber optic cables are all options. A wired network employs wires to link devices to the Internet or another network, such as laptops or desktop PCs.
Wireless means without wire, media that is made up of electromagnetic waves (EM Waves) or infrared waves. Antennas or sensors will be present on all wireless devices.  For data or voice communication, a wireless network uses radio frequency waves rather than wires.
A communication protocol is a set of rules that all devices follow when they share information. Some common protocols are TCP/IP, IEEE 802, Ethernet, wireless LAN, and cellular standards. TCP/IP is a model that organizes how communication works in modern networks. It has four functional layers for these communication links:
: This layer controls how data is physically transferred, including how hardware sends data through wires or fibers.
: This layer packages data into understandable packets and ensures it can be sent and received.
: This layer keeps the communication between devices steady and reliable.
: This layer allows high-level applications to access the network to start data transfer.
Most of the modern internet structure is based on the TCP/IP model, although the similar seven-layer OSI model still has a strong influence.
IEEE 802 is a group of standards for local area networks (LAN) and metropolitan area networks (MAN). The most well-known member of the IEEE 802 family is wireless LAN, commonly known as WLAN or Wi-Fi.
While nodes, links, and protocols are the building blocks of a network, a modern network also needs strong defenses. Security is crucial because huge amounts of data are constantly being created, moved, and processed. Some examples of network defense tools are firewalls, intrusion detection systems (
IDS
), intrusion prevention systems (
IPS
), network access control (
NAC
), content filters, proxy servers, anti-DDoS devices, and load balancers.
How Does a Computer Network Work?
Computer Networks simply work using nodes and links. Data communication equipment is simply termed as Nodes. For example, 
Modems
, Hubs, Switches, etc. whereas links in Computer networks can be referred to as a connection between two nodes. We have several types of links like cable wires, 
optical fibers
, etc. 
Whenever a Computer Network is working, nodes have the work of sending and receiving data via the links. Computer Network provides some set of protocols that help in following the rules and protocols.
It can be measured in many ways, including transmit time and response time. Transit time is the amount of time required for a message to travel from one device to another. Response time is the elapsed time between an inquiry and a response. The performance of the network depends on a number of factors, including the number of users, the type of medium & Hardware.
In addition to accuracy is measured by frequency of failure, the time it takes a link to recover from failure, and the network’s robustness in catastrophe. 
 Network security issues include protecting data from unauthorized access, protecting data from damage and development, and implementing policies and procedures for recovery from breaches and data loss.  
Programs do not have to execute on a single system because of resource and load sharing
Reduced costs – Multiple machines can share printers, tape drives, and other peripherals
Reliability – If one machine fails, another can take its place
Scalability (it’s simple to add more processors or computers)
Communication and mail (people living apart can work together)
Information Access (remote information access, access to the internet, e-mail, video conferencing, and online shopping)
Entertainment that is interactive (online games, videos, etc.)
Social Networking
Types of Computer Networks
 A 
LAN
 is a network that covers an area of around 10 kilometers. For example, a college network or an office network. Depending upon the needs of the organization, a LAN can be a single office, building, or Campus. We can have two PCs and one printer in-home office or it can extend throughout the company and include audio and video devices. Each host in LAN has an identifier, an address that defines hosts in LAN. A packet sent by the host to another host carries both the source host’s and the destination host’s address.
MAN
 refers to a network that covers an entire city. For example: consider the cable television network.
 
WAN
 refers to a network that connects countries or continents. For example, the Internet allows users to access a distributed system called www from anywhere around the globe.WAN interconnects connecting devices such as switches, routers, or modems. A LAN is normally privately owned by an organization that uses it. We see two distinct examples of WANs today: point-to-point WANs and Switched WANs 
: Connects two connecting devices through transmission media. 
 A switched WAN is a network with more than two ends.
 Point-to-Point networking
 is a type of data networking that establishes a direct link between two networking nodes.
A direct link between two devices, such as a computer and a printer, is known as a point-to-point connection.
: is the one in which more than two specific devices share links. In the multipoint environment, the capacity of the channel is shared, either spatially or temporally. If several devices can use the link simultaneously, it is a spatially shared connection. 
In
 broadcast networks
, a signal method in which numerous parties can hear a single sender. Radio stations are an excellent illustration of the “Broadcast Network” in everyday life. The radio station is a sender of data/signal in this scenario, and data is only intended to travel in one direction. Away from the radio transmission tower, to be precise.
Computers with similar capabilities and configurations are referred to as peers.
The “peers” in a
 peer-to-peer
 network are computer systems that are connected to each other over the Internet. Without the use of a central server, files can be shared directly between systems on the network.
Each computer or process on the network is either a client or a server in a client-server architecture (client/server). The client asks for services from the server, which the server provides. Servers are high-performance computers or processes that manage disc drives (file servers), printers (print servers), or network traffic (network servers)
The hybrid model  uses a combination of client-server and peer-to-peer architecture. Eg: Torrent.
Types of Computer Network Architecture
Computer Network Architecture is of two types. These types are mentioned below.
Client-Server Architecture
 is basically the architecture where the clients and the server are connected as two clients can communicate with each other and the devices present work as servers in the network.
Peer-to-Peer Architecture
, computers are connected to each other and each computer is equally capable of working as there is no central server here. Each device present here can be used as a client or server.
Types of Enterprise Computer Networks
There are three main types of Enterprise Computer Networks which are mentioned below.
Local Area Networks
 are small-scale networks used in small companies or as test networks. It has a limited size.
Wide Area Networks
 are networks that are used for a larger area than local area networks and are used for long-distance communication.
Service Provider Networks are the networks that help in wireless communication, high-speed internet access, etc.
No industry—whether it’s education, retail, finance, tech, government, or healthcare—can function without well-designed computer networks. The larger the organization, the more complex the network becomes. Before starting the challenging job of creating and setting up a computer network, here are some key objectives to consider.
Today’s enterprises are spread across the globe, with critical assets being shared across departments, geographies, and time zones. Clients are no more bound by location. A network allows data and hardware to be accessible to every pertinent user. This also helps with interdepartmental data processing. For example, the marketing team analyzes customer data and product development cycles to enable executive decisions at the top level.
A network ensures that resources are not stuck in isolated areas and can be accessed from multiple locations. High reliability comes from having various sources of supply. Important resources are backed up across multiple machines, so they remain accessible even if there are hardware problems.
As a company grows, its workload increases. Adding one or more processors to the network boosts the overall performance of the system and allows it to handle this growth. Storing data in well-designed databases can significantly speed up searching and retrieving information.
Big mainframe computers are costly, so it’s smarter to add processors strategically throughout the system. This boosts performance and saves money. Networks let employees access information quickly, saving operational time and costs. Centralized network administration means fewer investments are needed for IT support
Network-attached storage devices are great for employees who handle lots of data. For instance, the data science team doesn’t each need their own data storage for the large number of records they process. Centralized repositories are more efficient. As businesses deal with record amounts of customer data, the ability to expand storage capacity is crucial
Networks greatly influence how companies operate daily. Employees can share files, see each other’s work, sync calendars, and exchange ideas more efficiently. Internal messaging systems like Slack facilitate easy flow of information and conversations within modern enterprises. However, emails remain the formal mode of communication with clients, partners, and vendors.
Networks decrease errors by ensuring everyone gets information from one source, even if they’re in different places. 
Backed-up 
data ensures consistency and continuity. Standard versions of customer and employee manuals can be easily accessed by many people without much trouble
Computer networks offer flexibility, which is crucial during uncertain times like now when natural disasters and pandemics are affecting the world. A secure network guarantees that users can access and work on sensitive data safely, even when they’re not at the company’s location. Mobile devices registered to the network can also provide multiple layers of authentication, ensuring that unauthorized users can’t access the system.
What is Network Topology?
The structure of the network and how each component is connected to the others are defined by the network topology. Different types of network topology are mentioned below:
Bus Topology
Ring Topology
Star Topology
Mesh Topology
Tree Topology
Every computer and network device is connected to a single cable in a 
bus topology
 network. Linear Bus topology is defined as having exactly two terminals.
Installation is simple
Compared to mesh, star, and tree topologies, the bus utilizes less cabling
Difficulty in reconfiguring and isolating faults
A bus cable malfunction or break interrupts all communication
For more, you can refer to the 
Advantages and Disadvantages of Bus Topology.
The topology is named ring topology because one computer is connected to another, with the final one being connected to the first. Exactly two neighbors for each device. A signal is passed along the ring in one direction. Each ring incorporates a repeater. 
Data transmission is relatively straightforward because packets only move in one direction
There is no requirement for a central controller to manage communication between nodes
Easy installation & Reconfiguration
Simplified Faulty connections
In a Unidirectional Ring, a data packet must traverse through all nodes
All computers must be turned on in order for them to connect with one another
For more, you can refer to the 
Advantages and Disadvantages of Ring Topology.
Each device in a star topology has a dedicated point-to-point link to a central controller, which is commonly referred to as the HUB. There is no direct connection between the devices. Traffic between the devices is not allowed in this topology. As an exchange, the controller is used.
When attaching or disconnecting devices, there are no network interruptions
It’s simple to set up and configure
Identifying and isolating faults is simple
Less Expensive than mesh 
Easy to install & configure
Nodes attached to the hub, switch, or concentrator is failed if they fail
Because of the expense of the hubs, it is more expensive than linear bus topologies
More cable is required compared to a bus or ring 
Too much dependency on Hub
For more, you can refer to the
 Advantages and Disadvantages of Star Topology
.
 Used in high-speed LANs
Every device in a mesh topology has dedicated point-to-point connectivity to every other device. The term “dedicated” refers to the fact that the link exclusively transports data between the two devices it links. To connect n devices, a fully connected mesh network contains n *(n-1)/2 physical channels.
Data can be sent from multiple devices at the same time. This topology can handle a lot of traffic.
Even if one of the connections fails, a backup is always available. As a result, data transit is unaffected.
Physical boundaries prevent other users from gaining access to messages.
Point to Point links make fault transmission & fault isolation easy.
The amount of cabling and the number of I/O ports that are necessary.
The sheer bulk of wiring can be greater than the available space can accommodate.
It is difficult to install and reconfigure.
For more, you can refer to the 
Advantages and Disadvantages of Mesh Topology
.
  connection of telephone regional office in which each regional office needs to be connected to every other regional office. 
The topology of a tree is similar to that of a star. Nodes in a tree, like those in a star, are connected to a central hub that manages network traffic. It has a root node, which is connected to all other nodes, producing a hierarchy. Hierarchical topology is another name for it. The number of Star networks is connected via Bus in Tree Topology.
Network expansion is both possible and simple.
We partition the entire network into pieces (star networks) that are easier to manage and maintain.
Other segments are unaffected if one segment is damaged.
Tree topology relies largely on the main bus cable because of its basic structure, and if it fails, the entire network is handicapped.
Maintenance becomes more challenging when more nodes and segments are added.
For more, you can refer to the 
Advantages and Disadvantages of Tree Topology
.
What is Internet?
The Internet is a larger network that allows computer networks controlled by enterprises, governments, colleges, and other organizations all over the world to communicate with one another. As a result, there is a tangle of cables, computers, data centers, 
routers
, servers, repeaters, 
satellites
, and Wi-Fi towers that allow digital data to go around the world.
The Internet is a vast network of networks that functions as a networking infrastructure. It links millions of computers throughout the world, creating a network in which any computer can talk with any other computer as long as they are both linked to the Internet. The Internet is a global network of interconnected computers that communicate and share information using a standardized
 Internet Protocol
 Suite.
We can connect to the internet in the following ways:
 In order to access the Internet, in this type of connection, users must connect their phone line to a computer. This link prevents the user from using tier home phone service to make or receive calls.
 Broadband is a high-speed internet connection that is frequently utilized nowadays and is provided by 
cable
 or phone companies.
 Internet access is accomplished by 
radio waves
, thus it is possible to connect to the Internet from any location. 
Wi-Fi 
and mobile service providers are examples of wireless connections.
Advantages of the Internet 
 Online gaming, talking, browsing, music, movies, dramas, and TV series are quickly becoming the most popular ways to pass the time.
 There is no better place to conduct research than the internet. We can learn about the latest trends, communicate with experts without having to physically visit them, and seek professional advice over the Internet.
 With the advancement of internet technology, large online 
E-commerce 
enterprises such as Amazon, Ali Baba, myntra, etc. have emerged.
Working from home, collaborating with others, and having access to a global workforce are all advantages.
 Because there are hundreds of thousands of newsgroups and services that keep you updated with every tick of the clock, the Internet is a source of the most recent news.
Disadvantages of the Internet 
 Most people believe that spending too much time on the 
internet
 is unhealthy for young people and leads to obesity. 
 Aside from reputable sites, there are some 
Social Media Advertising
 sites that try to steal your personal information, credit card information, and even your pin code. You can easily become a victim of money scams if they get this information.
 It is now quite easy to decipher someone’s chat or email communication thanks to the hacking community. As we all know, data is transmitted in packets, which hackers can simply detect and reconstruct.
 Bullies exist online, just as they do in real life, and they can lower your self-esteem by harassing and threatening you. Some of these individuals may be persons who are aware of some of your personal details and dislike you and may use this information to harass you.
Conclusion
In conclusion, computer networking is essential because it allows computers to connect and communicate with each other. This connectivity enables them to share information and resources, making tasks easier and faster. Whether it’s a small network within a home or office (
LAN
) or a large network spreading across cities and countries (
WAN
), networking helps us stay connected, work together, and access the internet. It’s like having a team where everyone can instantly share ideas and tools, making collaboration smooth and efficient. So, computer networking is all about making connections that help us stay informed, productive, and connected to the world.

We can have two PCs and one printer in-home office or it can extend throughout the company and include audio and video devices. Each host in LAN has an identifier, an address that defines hosts in LAN. A packet sent by the host to another host carries both the source host’s and the destination host’s address.
MAN
 refers to a network that covers an entire city. For example: consider the cable television network.
 
WAN
 refers to a network that connects countries or continents. For example, the Internet allows users to access a distributed system called www from anywhere around the globe.WAN interconnects connecting devices such as switches, routers, or modems. A LAN is normally privately owned by an organization that uses it. We see two distinct examples of WANs today: point-to-point WANs and Switched WANs 
: Connects two connecting devices through transmission media. 
 A switched WAN is a network with more than two ends.
 Point-to-Point networking
 is a type of data networking that establishes a direct link between two networking nodes.
A direct link between two devices, such as a computer and a printer, is known as a point-to-point connection.
: is the one in which more than two specific devices share links. In the multipoint environment, the capacity of the channel is shared, either spatially or temporally. If several devices can use the link simultaneously, it is a spatially shared connection. 
In
 broadcast networks
, a signal method in which numerous parties can hear a single sender. Radio stations are an excellent illustration of the “Broadcast Network” in everyday life. The radio station is a sender of data/signal in this scenario, and data is only intended to travel in one direction. Away from the radio transmission tower, to be precise.
Computers with similar capabilities and configurations are referred to as peers.
The “peers” in a
 peer-to-peer
 network are computer systems that are connected to each other over the Internet. Without the use of a central server, files can be shared directly between systems on the network.
Each computer or process on the network is either a client or a server in a client-server architecture (client/server). The client asks for services from the server, which the server provides. Servers are high-performance computers or processes that manage disc drives (file servers), printers (print servers), or network traffic (network servers)
The hybrid model  uses a combination of client-server and peer-to-peer architecture. Eg: Torrent.
Types of Computer Network Architecture
Computer Network Architecture is of two types. These types are mentioned below.
Client-Server Architecture
 is basically the architecture where the clients and the server are connected as two clients can communicate with each other and the devices present work as servers in the network.
Peer-to-Peer Architecture
, computers are connected to each other and each computer is equally capable of working as there is no central server here. Each device present here can be used as a client or server.
Types of Enterprise Computer Networks
There are three main types of Enterprise Computer Networks which are mentioned below.
Local Area Networks
 are small-scale networks used in small companies or as test networks. It has a limited size.
Wide Area Networks
 are networks that are used for a larger area than local area networks and are used for long-distance communication.
Service Provider Networks are the networks that help in wireless communication, high-speed internet access, etc.
No industry—whether it’s education, retail, finance, tech, government, or healthcare—can function without well-designed computer networks. The larger the organization, the more complex the network becomes. Before starting the challenging job of creating and setting up a computer network, here are some key objectives to consider.
Today’s enterprises are spread across the globe, with critical assets being shared across departments, geographies, and time zones. Clients are no more bound by location. A network allows data and hardware to be accessible to every pertinent user. This also helps with interdepartmental data processing. For example, the marketing team analyzes customer data and product development cycles to enable executive decisions at the top level.
A network ensures that resources are not stuck in isolated areas and can be accessed from multiple locations. High reliability comes from having various sources of supply. Important resources are backed up across multiple machines, so they remain accessible even if there are hardware problems.
As a company grows, its workload increases. Adding one or more processors to the network boosts the overall performance of the system and allows it to handle this growth. Storing data in well-designed databases can significantly speed up searching and retrieving information.
Big mainframe computers are costly, so it’s smarter to add processors strategically throughout the system. This boosts performance and saves money. Networks let employees access information quickly, saving operational time and costs. Centralized network administration means fewer investments are needed for IT support
Network-attached storage devices are great for employees who handle lots of data. For instance, the data science team doesn’t each need their own data storage for the large number of records they process. Centralized repositories are more efficient. As businesses deal with record amounts of customer data, the ability to expand storage capacity is crucial
Networks greatly influence how companies operate daily. Employees can share files, see each other’s work, sync calendars, and exchange ideas more efficiently. Internal messaging systems like Slack facilitate easy flow of information and conversations within modern enterprises. However, emails remain the formal mode of communication with clients, partners, and vendors.
Networks decrease errors by ensuring everyone gets information from one source, even if they’re in different places. 
Backed-up 
data ensures consistency and continuity. Standard versions of customer and employee manuals can be easily accessed by many people without much trouble
Computer networks offer flexibility, which is crucial during uncertain times like now when natural disasters and pandemics are affecting the world. A secure network guarantees that users can access and work on sensitive data safely, even when they’re not at the company’s location. Mobile devices registered to the network can also provide multiple layers of authentication, ensuring that unauthorized users can’t access the system.
What is Network Topology?
The structure of the network and how each component is connected to the others are defined by the network topology. Different types of network topology are mentioned below:
Bus Topology
Ring Topology
Star Topology
Mesh Topology
Tree Topology
Every computer and network device is connected to a single cable in a 
bus topology
 network. Linear Bus topology is defined as having exactly two terminals.
Installation is simple
Compared to mesh, star, and tree topologies, the bus utilizes less cabling
Difficulty in reconfiguring and isolating faults
A bus cable malfunction or break interrupts all communication
For more, you can refer to the 
Advantages and Disadvantages of Bus Topology.
The topology is named ring topology because one computer is connected to another, with the final one being connected to the first. Exactly two neighbors for each device. A signal is passed along the ring in one direction. Each ring incorporates a repeater. 
Data transmission is relatively straightforward because packets only move in one direction
There is no requirement for a central controller to manage communication between nodes
Easy installation & Reconfiguration
Simplified Faulty connections
In a Unidirectional Ring, a data packet must traverse through all nodes
All computers must be turned on in order for them to connect with one another
For more, you can refer to the 
Advantages and Disadvantages of Ring Topology.
Each device in a star topology has a dedicated point-to-point link to a central controller, which is commonly referred to as the HUB. There is no direct connection between the devices. Traffic between the devices is not allowed in this topology. As an exchange, the controller is used.
When attaching or disconnecting devices, there are no network interruptions
It’s simple to set up and configure
Identifying and isolating faults is simple
Less Expensive than mesh 
Easy to install & configure
Nodes attached to the hub, switch, or concentrator is failed if they fail
Because of the expense of the hubs, it is more expensive than linear bus topologies
More cable is required compared to a bus or ring 
Too much dependency on Hub
For more, you can refer to the
 Advantages and Disadvantages of Star Topology
.
 Used in high-speed LANs
Every device in a mesh topology has dedicated point-to-point connectivity to every other device. The term “dedicated” refers to the fact that the link exclusively transports data between the two devices it links. To connect n devices, a fully connected mesh network contains n *(n-1)/2 physical channels.
Data can be sent from multiple devices at the same time. This topology can handle a lot of traffic.
Even if one of the connections fails, a backup is always available. As a result, data transit is unaffected.
Physical boundaries prevent other users from gaining access to messages.
Point to Point links make fault transmission & fault isolation easy.
The amount of cabling and the number of I/O ports that are necessary.
The sheer bulk of wiring can be greater than the available space can accommodate.
It is difficult to install and reconfigure.
For more, you can refer to the 
Advantages and Disadvantages of Mesh Topology
.
  connection of telephone regional office in which each regional office needs to be connected to every other regional office. 
The topology of a tree is similar to that of a star. Nodes in a tree, like those in a star, are connected to a central hub that manages network traffic. It has a root node, which is connected to all other nodes, producing a hierarchy. Hierarchical topology is another name for it. The number of Star networks is connected via Bus in Tree Topology.
Network expansion is both possible and simple.
We partition the entire network into pieces (star networks) that are easier to manage and maintain.
Other segments are unaffected if one segment is damaged.
Tree topology relies largely on the main bus cable because of its basic structure, and if it fails, the entire network is handicapped.
Maintenance becomes more challenging when more nodes and segments are added.
For more, you can refer to the 
Advantages and Disadvantages of Tree Topology
.
What is Internet?
The Internet is a larger network that allows computer networks controlled by enterprises, governments, colleges, and other organizations all over the world to communicate with one another. As a result, there is a tangle of cables, computers, data centers, 
routers
, servers, repeaters, 
satellites
, and Wi-Fi towers that allow digital data to go around the world.
The Internet is a vast network of networks that functions as a networking infrastructure. It links millions of computers throughout the world, creating a network in which any computer can talk with any other computer as long as they are both linked to the Internet. The Internet is a global network of interconnected computers that communicate and share information using a standardized
 Internet Protocol
 Suite.
We can connect to the internet in the following ways:
 In order to access the Internet, in this type of connection, users must connect their phone line to a computer. This link prevents the user from using tier home phone service to make or receive calls.
 Broadband is a high-speed internet connection that is frequently utilized nowadays and is provided by 
cable
 or phone companies.
 Internet access is accomplished by 
radio waves
, thus it is possible to connect to the Internet from any location. 
Wi-Fi 
and mobile service providers are examples of wireless connections.
Advantages of the Internet 
 Online gaming, talking, browsing, music, movies, dramas, and TV series are quickly becoming the most popular ways to pass the time.
 There is no better place to conduct research than the internet. We can learn about the latest trends, communicate with experts without having to physically visit them, and seek professional advice over the Internet.
 With the advancement of internet technology, large online 
E-commerce 
enterprises such as Amazon, Ali Baba, myntra, etc. have emerged.
Working from home, collaborating with others, and having access to a global workforce are all advantages.
 Because there are hundreds of thousands of newsgroups and services that keep you updated with every tick of the clock, the Internet is a source of the most recent news.
Disadvantages of the Internet 
 Most people believe that spending too much time on the 
internet
 is unhealthy for young people and leads to obesity. 
 Aside from reputable sites, there are some 
Social Media Advertising
 sites that try to steal your personal information, credit card information, and even your pin code. You can easily become a victim of money scams if they get this information.
 It is now quite easy to decipher someone’s chat or email communication thanks to the hacking community. As we all know, data is transmitted in packets, which hackers can simply detect and reconstruct.
 Bullies exist online, just as they do in real life, and they can lower your self-esteem by harassing and threatening you. Some of these individuals may be persons who are aware of some of your personal details and dislike you and may use this information to harass you.
Conclusion
In conclusion, computer networking is essential because it allows computers to connect and communicate with each other. This connectivity enables them to share information and resources, making tasks easier and faster. Whether it’s a small network within a home or office (
LAN
) or a large network spreading across cities and countries (
WAN
), networking helps us stay connected, work together, and access the internet. It’s like having a team where everyone can instantly share ideas and tools, making collaboration smooth and efficient. So, computer networking is all about making connections that help us stay informed, productive, and connected to the world.

22. Discuss any four factors responsible for the decline of feudalism.
Factors responsible for the decline of feudalism: a. 
 The growth of trade and commerce during the late Middle Ages led to the rise of a money-based economy. Feudalism was based on a land-based economy, and the shift to a cash-based economy reduced the importance of land ownership, weakening feudal lords’ power.
b. 
 The Black Death, a devastating pandemic in the 14th century, led to a significant reduction in the population. This labor shortage gave serfs and peasants more bargaining power, leading to the decline of serfdom as lords had to offer better conditions to retain labor.
c. 
 The emergence of strong centralized nation-states with powerful monarchs undermined the authority of local feudal lords. Kings and monarchs sought to consolidate power, often at the expense of the nobility.
 What types of duties serfs had accepted to do?
Serfs in feudal society had various duties, including: 
Working the lord’s land and producing agricultural goods.
Paying taxes or tributes to the lord, often in the form of a portion of their agricultural produce. 
Providing military service when called upon to defend the lord’s estate or the realm. d. Performing other labor-intensive tasks like maintaining roads and bridges.
23. Enlist the names of women who were intellectually creative during the period of Renaissance in Europe. 
Women intellectuals during the Renaissance in Europe: Some notable women who were intellectually creative during the Renaissance include: a. 
 She was an Italian-French author who wrote on various subjects, including feminism and the role of women in society. b. 
 An Italian noblewoman known for her patronage of the arts and her correspondence with renowned Renaissance figures. c. 
 An Italian humanist and writer who defended women’s right to education and wrote on various philosophical and social topics.
24. Discuss the economic development made in Rome in the late antiquity. What was its result?
Economic development in Rome in late antiquity and its result: During late antiquity, Rome witnessed economic developments such as: 
 The Roman Empire’s vast network of roads and sea routes facilitated trade across regions and with distant civilizations. 
 Improved farming techniques and the introduction of new crops led to increased agricultural productivity. 
 Cities grew in size and complexity, with a concentration of economic activities and populations.
The result of these developments was increased wealth and prosperity in some regions, but it also contributed to economic disparities and social unrest. The decline of the Roman Empire was partly attributed to the strain on resources and the unequal distribution of wealth.
25. Discuss how daily life was transformed as Japan developed.
Transformation of daily life as Japan developed: As Japan developed economically and socially: 
a. 
 Cities grew, and urban life became more common. People shifted from rural areas to urban centers to pursue employment and economic opportunities. b. 
 The adoption of Western technology and ideas led to modernization in various aspects of life, including industry, transportation, and education. c. 
 The traditional samurai class declined in influence, while a new middle class emerged. Social mobility increased, and new opportunities for education and employment became available.
26. Write about the town planning of the Mesopotamian cities.
Town planning of Mesopotamian cities: Mesopotamian cities were typically characterized by: a. 
 Central to many Mesopotamian cities, ziggurats were stepped temple towers that served both religious and administrative purposes. b. 
 Most buildings in Mesopotamian cities were constructed using mud bricks, which were readily available in the region. c. 
 Many cities had defensive walls for protection against external threats. d. 
 Streets and city layouts often followed a grid pattern, with houses and buildings organized in a structured manner.
27. How did the amalgamation of different castes and communities give birth to a new civilization?
Amalgamation of castes and communities giving birth to a new civilization: The amalgamation of different castes and communities in India gave rise to a new civilization due to several factors: a. 
 The mixing of diverse cultural practices, traditions, and beliefs led to the development of a rich and syncretic culture. b. 
 Increased trade and economic activities necessitated cooperation among various groups, leading to social integration and the emergence of a shared economic system. c. 
 Over time, intermarriage between different communities and castes contributed to the blending of social and genetic boundaries. d. 
 The need for governance and administration resulted in the establishment of centralized political structures that united people of various backgrounds.
This amalgamation ultimately gave birth to a diverse and inclusive civilization that celebrated cultural pluralism and contributed to the development of a unique societal fabric in India.
“The use of seals played significant role in the development of trade and urbanisation in Mesopotamia.” Discuss.
The use of seals played a significant role in the development of trade and urbanization in Mesopotamia for several reasons:
 Seals were used to mark and secure goods and containers for trade. Merchants and traders would imprint seals onto clay tablets or the surface of containers to indicate ownership, contents, and authenticity. This helped in preventing theft and ensuring the integrity of trade transactions.
 Seals were also used to create impressions on clay tablets that contained important records, including trade agreements, receipts, and contracts. These seals provided a form of authentication and served as proof of legal and financial transactions. They helped maintain accurate records and ensure accountability in trade.
 Seals often featured intricate designs, symbols, and inscriptions unique to specific individuals, institutions, or authorities. These standardized marks provided a consistent and recognizable form of identification, enabling traders and officials to quickly assess the authenticity of documents and goods.
28. Why did the nomadic organisation of the Mongols have to trade with China? What effect did this trade cast on the Chinese economy and politics?
The nomadic organization of the Mongols, under leaders like Genghis Khan and later Khans, relied on trade with China for several reasons:
 The Mongols, primarily pastoral nomads, lacked the agricultural resources and settled civilization needed to sustain a large population. China, on the other hand, was a rich and populous agricultural society. Trade with China provided the Mongols with access to essential goods like grains, textiles, and manufactured products.
 China’s geographical proximity and its well-developed Silk Road trade routes made it a vital trading partner for the Mongols. The Silk Road facilitated the exchange of goods, technologies, and cultural influences between the nomadic Mongols and the sedentary Chinese.
 The Mongol rulers recognized the economic benefits of trade with China. They imposed taxes and tariffs on goods passing through their territory, which included the lucrative trade routes connecting China to Central Asia and the West. This revenue contributed to the Mongol treasury.
 Trade with China allowed for the exchange of ideas, technologies, and cultural practices. The Mongols adopted elements of Chinese culture, such as paper currency, administration, and certain agricultural practices.
The trade between the Mongols and China had significant effects on the Chinese economy and politics:
 The increased trade along the Silk Road brought economic prosperity to many Chinese cities, especially those located along the trade routes. It stimulated the growth of markets, industries, and urban centers.
 Chinese culture spread along with trade, influencing Mongol rulers and the areas under their control. This cultural diffusion led to the adoption of Chinese governance systems, legal codes, and art forms in parts of the Mongol Empire.
 The Mongols established the Yuan Dynasty in China in the 13th century, with Kublai Khan as its leader. This marked the first time that non-Chinese rulers had established a dynasty in China. Mongol rule significantly impacted Chinese politics, administration, and society during this period.
 The Mongols introduced administrative reforms based on their experiences with governing vast territories. They retained a centralized bureaucracy and implemented policies that promoted trade and stability, contributing to economic development.
 The Mongols also improved transportation and communication infrastructure, facilitating the movement of people and goods within their empire, including China. This further boosted trade and economic growth.
In summary, trade between the nomadic Mongols and China had far-reaching effects on both sides. It facilitated economic prosperity, cultural exchange, and administrative changes, while also marking a unique period of foreign rule in Chinese history under the Mongol-led Yuan Dynasty.
Who was Genghis Khan? How did he become the Great Khan of the Mongols?
Genghis Khan, whose birth name was Temüjin, was a legendary Mongol leader who founded the Mongol Empire, one of the largest contiguous land empires in history. His journey to becoming the Great Khan of the Mongols was marked by a series of remarkable achievements and strategic decisions. Here is an 8-mark answer detailing his life and rise to power:
Genghis Khan was born around 1162 on the Mongolian steppe, a harsh and nomadic region. He was born into the Borjigin clan, but his early life was marked by adversity and challenges.
His father was poisoned when Genghis Khan was only nine years old, leaving his family in a vulnerable position. This early loss forced him to fend for himself and his family in a hostile environment.
Temüjin’s early years were marked by a struggle for survival, and he learned valuable skills such as horsemanship, archery, and survival tactics on the Mongolian steppe.
In his late teens and early twenties, he managed to build a small following of loyal supporters and friends, who helped him establish himself as a leader within his clan.
He began to unite various Mongol and Turkic tribes under his leadership, using a combination of diplomacy, alliances, and military prowess. His ability to form alliances was crucial to his rise.
One of Genghis Khan’s most significant achievements was the unification of the Mongol tribes. He pursued a vision of a united Mongol nation and tirelessly worked toward this goal.
Through a series of military campaigns and alliances, Genghis Khan defeated rival Mongol leaders and tribal chiefs. His charisma, military acumen, and a strict code of loyalty among his followers were instrumental in his success.
Genghis Khan’s military campaigns were marked by innovative tactics and strategies. He incorporated lessons learned from various conquered peoples and adapted his forces accordingly.
His conquests extended beyond Mongolia, as he launched campaigns into neighboring regions, including China, Central Asia, and the Khwarezmian Empire (Persia). These campaigns gradually expanded the Mongol Empire.
In 1206, Genghis Khan convened a khurultai (a gathering of Mongol chiefs) where he was officially proclaimed as the Great Khan of the Mongols. This marked the establishment of a unified Mongol state under his leadership.
As the Great Khan, Genghis Khan implemented a code of laws, known as the Yassa, which helped govern his vast empire. He promoted religious freedom and tolerance, encouraging the exchange of ideas and technologies among the different cultures within his realm.
Genghis Khan’s leadership and conquests laid the foundation for the Mongol Empire’s continued expansion under his successors, including his grandsons Kublai Khan and Hulagu Khan.
His legacy includes not only the empire’s territorial conquests but also the Silk Road trade, cultural exchanges, and the spread of ideas across Eurasia.
In conclusion, Genghis Khan’s rise to become the Great Khan of the Mongols was a remarkable journey characterized by determination, military prowess, strategic alliances, and a vision of uniting the Mongol tribes. His leadership left an indelible mark on history, shaping the course of Asia and Europe for centuries to come.
29. Briefly discuss Aggressive Nationalism, Westernisation, and Tradition in Japan.
Aggressive Nationalism, Westernization, and Tradition played crucial roles in shaping Japan’s modernization during the Meiji period (1868-1912) and beyond. Here is an 8-mark discussion of these three elements:
During the Meiji Restoration, Japan underwent a significant transformation from a feudal society to a centralized nation-state. A key aspect of this transformation was the promotion of aggressive nationalism, emphasizing the uniqueness and superiority of Japan’s culture and identity.
Kokutai, meaning “national essence” or “national polity,” became a central theme in Japanese political ideology. It stressed the divine and unbroken lineage of the Japanese emperor, portraying him as the symbol of national unity and identity.
Aggressive nationalism was used to justify Japan’s expansionist policies in Asia, leading to events such as the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895) and the Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905), where Japan sought to establish its dominance in the region.
The Meiji leaders recognized the need to modernize Japan to defend against Western imperial powers and maintain sovereignty. This led to a deliberate process of Westernization, known as Bunmei Kaika or the “civilization and enlightenment” movement.
Japan adopted various Western institutions and technologies, including a constitutional government modeled after Germany’s, a modern legal system, and industrialization methods. Westernization also extended to education, military organization, and infrastructure development.
The goal was to create a strong, modernized Japan that could compete on equal footing with Western powers and resist colonization. The process was characterized by a selective approach, where Japan adopted Western elements while preserving its cultural identity.
Amidst aggressive nationalism and Westernization, there was a simultaneous effort to maintain and revive traditional Japanese culture and values. This concept is often referred to as Nihonjinron, which emphasized the uniqueness and superiority of Japanese cultural traditions.
Traditional Japanese arts, such as tea ceremonies, martial arts like judo and kendo, and traditional clothing like kimono, were promoted and preserved. Efforts were made to balance modernization with the preservation of traditional values.
Nihonjinron also played a role in shaping Japan’s national identity, emphasizing the continuity of Japanese culture even in the face of rapid modernization.
In summary, Aggressive Nationalism, Westernization, and Tradition were three interconnected elements in Japan’s modernization during the Meiji period. They reflected Japan’s pursuit of a strong national identity, modernization, and the preservation of its cultural heritage. This complex mix of ideologies and policies helped Japan transform from a feudal society into a modern industrialized nation while maintaining a distinct sense of Japanese identity and tradition.
Why did Japan and Germany join, the Anti-Comintern Pact in 1936? What were its objectives?
Japan and Germany joined the Anti-Comintern Pact in 1936 for a combination of political, strategic, and ideological reasons. The Anti-Comintern Pact was an anti-communist agreement signed initially between Germany and Japan, with Italy later joining. Here are the key reasons for their participation and the objectives of the pact:
One of the primary reasons for Japan and Germany joining the Anti-Comintern Pact was their strong opposition to the spread of communism. Both nations perceived communism, particularly Soviet communism, as a threat to their political ideologies, systems, and territorial ambitions.
Germany under Adolf Hitler’s Nazi regime viewed communism as a political rival and an ideological enemy. Japan, on the other hand, was concerned about Soviet influence in Asia, particularly in regions like Manchuria and Mongolia.
Germany and Japan felt diplomatically isolated and encircled by the Western democracies and the Soviet Union. By forming the Anti-Comintern Pact, they aimed to counterbalance this isolation by building a coalition of like-minded states against the communist ideology.
Germany was concerned about the Soviet Union’s increasing influence in Eastern Europe, and Japan sought to protect its interests in China and maintain its dominance in Manchuria.
Both Germany and Japan were authoritarian regimes with expansionist ambitions. They shared some ideological commonalities, such as ultra-nationalism, militarism, and anti-communism, which made cooperation more appealing.
These nations saw potential benefits in aligning with each other, as well as with Italy when it joined the pact later, to strengthen their political and military positions in the international arena.
The Anti-Comintern Pact included provisions for military consultations and cooperation in the event of a Soviet attack on any of the signatory states. This served as a deterrent against potential Soviet aggression.
The pact allowed for the exchange of military intelligence and strategies, which was strategically advantageous for Germany and Japan as they pursued their territorial ambitions.
Both Germany and Japan had expansionist agendas that were in conflict with the territorial interests of the Soviet Union. Germany aimed to expand into Eastern Europe, while Japan sought to expand in China and Southeast Asia.
The pact allowed for a degree of coordination in pursuing these expansionist objectives, aligning their efforts against common perceived threats.
In summary, Japan and Germany joined the Anti-Comintern Pact in 1936 due to their shared opposition to communism, concerns about isolation and encirclement, ideological alignment, and the pursuit of expansionist goals. The pact served as a means of strengthening their diplomatic and military positions, particularly in the face of the perceived threat posed by the Soviet Union and communism.
30. What steps were taken for the rights and interests of the natives in North America? What is their present position?
The treatment of Native Americans in North America has been marked by a complex history of interactions with European colonizers, the U.S. government, and evolving policies over the centuries. Here are some key steps taken, both historically and in recent times, to address the rights and interests of Native Americans, along with their present position:
 The U.S. government entered into numerous treaties with Native American tribes, recognizing their land rights and sovereignty. These treaties established reservations and promised various forms of assistance, including education and health care.
 This act aimed to assimilate Native Americans into mainstream American society by dividing tribal lands into individual allotments. However, it often resulted in the loss of tribal lands and weakened tribal identities.
 Also known as the Wheeler-Howard Act, this law encouraged tribal self-government and cultural preservation. It allowed tribes to draft constitutions and establish governments.
 Native Americans participated in the broader civil rights movement of the 1960s and 1970s, advocating for their rights and drawing attention to issues like discrimination, poverty, and educational disparities.
 Many Native American tribes have retained a degree of sovereignty and self-governance. They have tribal governments that manage their affairs, including education, law enforcement, and economic development, within their reservations.
 Land remains a central issue. Some tribes have been successful in regaining control over ancestral lands through litigation and negotiations. However, land disputes and issues related to land management continue.
 Educational opportunities for Native American youth remain a concern. While there have been efforts to improve access to quality education, many Native American schools face challenges such as underfunding and inadequate resources.
 Some tribes have diversified their economies by engaging in gaming and other industries. Economic self-sufficiency remains a goal for many tribes to reduce poverty and unemployment.
 The Indian Health Service (IHS) provides healthcare services to many Native Americans, but challenges persist, including disparities in healthcare access and outcomes.
 Many tribes continue efforts to preserve and revitalize their languages, traditions, and cultural practices. Cultural revitalization is seen as essential for the survival of tribal identities.
 Legal battles continue over issues such as tribal recognition, land rights, and the protection of sacred sites. Tribes often engage in legal actions to defend their rights and interests.
 Despite progress in some areas, many Native American communities still face high poverty rates, substance abuse issues, and limited access to quality healthcare and education. Social and economic disparities persist.
In conclusion, while there have been efforts to address the rights and interests of Native Americans in North America, challenges and disparities persist. Many Native American communities continue to advocate for their rights, sovereignty, and the preservation of their cultures in the face of ongoing issues related to land, education, healthcare, and economic development.
Explain the role of Gold Rush in economic and political expansion of America.
The Gold Rush played a significant role in the economic and political expansion of America, particularly during the 19th century. One of the most famous Gold Rushes was the California Gold Rush of 1848-1855. Here’s an explanation of its impact on economic and political expansion:
 The discovery of gold in California led to a massive influx of people from across the United States and around the world. Tens of thousands of prospectors, known as “Forty-Niners,” rushed to California in search of fortune. This rapid population growth spurred the development of towns and cities, transforming California from a sparsely populated region into a bustling, urbanized state.
 The need to support the growing population and facilitate mining operations led to significant infrastructure development. Roads, bridges, and transportation networks were built to connect mining areas to ports and markets. This infrastructure development had long-lasting benefits for the region’s economic growth.
 While gold mining was the primary focus, the Gold Rush led to the diversification of the economy. Businesses related to mining, such as suppliers of mining equipment, food, clothing, and entertainment, flourished. Agriculture and trade also expanded to meet the demands of the growing population.
 The Gold Rush contributed to the establishment of financial institutions such as banks and mints, which were essential for managing the influx of gold and providing a stable financial foundation for economic growth.
 The rapid population growth resulting from the Gold Rush prompted California to seek statehood. California’s admission to the Union as the 31st state in 1850 was a significant political development, as it tipped the balance of power in favor of free states in Congress, ultimately contributing to the sectional tensions that led to the American Civil War.
 The lure of gold also played a role in westward expansion. As prospectors moved further west in search of riches, they explored and settled in territories that were not yet part of the United States. This expansion set the stage for further territorial acquisitions and the eventual completion of the transcontinental railroad.
 The Gold Rush influenced federal policies related to land ownership, mining regulations, and Native American relations. The federal government implemented mining laws and regulations to govern mining activities and land rights in the newly settled regions.
 The Gold Rush had a long-term impact on migration patterns, with people continuing to move westward in search of economic opportunities. This migration contributed to the exploration and settlement of other western territories and states.
In summary, the Gold Rush, particularly the California Gold Rush, had profound economic and political effects on the expansion of America. It spurred economic growth, urbanization, infrastructure development, and diversification of the economy. Politically, it led to the admission of California as a state, influenced territorial expansion, and shaped federal policies related to land and mining. The Gold Rush played a pivotal role in the westward expansion and transformation of the United States during the 19th century.
31. Read the text carefully and answer the questions: 
Copernicus asserted that the planets, including the earth, rotate around the sun. A devout Christian, Copernicus was afraid of the possible reaction to his theory by traditionalist clergymen. For this reason, he did not want his manuscript, De revolutionibus (The Rotation) to be printed. On his deathbed, he gave it to his follower, Joachim Rheticus. It took time for people to accept this idea. It was much later – more than half a century later, in fact – that the difference between ‘heaven’ and earth was bridged through the writings of astronomers like Johannes Kepler (1571-1630) and Galileo Galilei (1564-1642). The theory of the earth as part of a sun-centred system was made popular by Kepler’s Cosmographical Mystery, which demonstrated that the planets move around the sun not in circles but in ellipses. Galileo confirmed the notion of the dynamic world in his work The Motion. This revolution in science reached its climax with Isaac Newton’s theory of gravitation. 
1. Explain the Christian notion of the universe and earth.
 In the context of the text, the Christian notion of the universe and earth refers to the prevailing cosmological beliefs held by the Christian Church during the time of Copernicus and the Middle Ages. These beliefs were influenced by a combination of religious teachings, ancient Greek and Roman ideas, and medieval interpretations. Here’s an overview:
 The Christian notion of the universe was geocentric, meaning that it placed the Earth at the center of the cosmos. This idea was heavily influenced by the Ptolemaic model, attributed to the ancient Greek astronomer Claudius Ptolemy, which proposed that the Earth was stationary and that all celestial bodies, including the planets and the sun, orbited around it.
 Geocentrism was also supported by certain biblical passages that were interpreted as suggesting the Earth’s central position in the universe. For example, passages like Psalm 104:5 and Ecclesiastes 1:5 were often cited to support the idea of a fixed Earth.
 The Christian Church endorsed the geocentric model because it reinforced the idea of humanity’s special place in the universe. It aligned with the theological belief that Earth was the focal point of God’s creation, and the heavens were arranged in concentric spheres, with God residing in the outermost sphere.
2. Why did Copernicus not print his manuscript? 
Copernicus did not want his manuscript, “De revolutionibus” (The Rotation), to be printed during his lifetime primarily due to concerns about potential reactions from traditionalist clergymen and the religious authorities of the time. Copernicus was a devout Christian himself, and he understood that his heliocentric theory, which proposed that the planets, including Earth, revolved around the sun, challenged the geocentric model that had been accepted for centuries.
Copernicus likely feared that his theory would be met with strong opposition from the Church, as it contradicted the established Christian notion of a geocentric universe. He may have been concerned about facing charges of heresy or being subjected to persecution. Therefore, to avoid controversy and potential backlash during his lifetime, Copernicus chose not to publish his work.
3. Name the manuscript that Copernicus hand over to his follower Joachim Rheticus.
Copernicus handed over his manuscript “De revolutionibus” (The Rotation) to his follower Joachim Rheticus on his deathbed. This manuscript contained Copernicus’s groundbreaking heliocentric theory, which laid the foundation for the modern understanding of the solar system and challenged the geocentric worldview of the time. Rheticus played a significant role in helping to disseminate Copernicus’s ideas and initiate the process of publishing “De revolutionibus” after Copernicus’s death.
32. Read the text carefully and answer the questions: 
The Roman Empire can broadly be divided into two phases, ‘early’ and ‘late’, divided by the third century as a sort of historical watershed between them. In other words, the whole period down to the main part of the third century can be called the ‘early empire’, and the period after that the ‘late empire’. A major difference between the two superpowers and their respective empires was that the Roman Empire was culturally much more diverse than that of Iran. The Parthians and later the Sasanians, the dynasties that ruled Iran in this period, ruled over a population that was largely Iranian. The Roman Empire, by contrast, was a mosaic of territories and cultures that were chiefly bound together by a common system of government. Many languages were spoken in the empire, but for the purposes of administration Latin and Greek were the most widely used, indeed the only languages. The upper classes of the east spoke and wrote in Greek, those of the west in Latin, and the boundary between these broad language areas ran somewhere across the middle of the Mediterranean, between the African provinces of Tripolitania and Cyrenaica. All those who lived in the empire were subjects of a single ruler, the emperor, regardless of where they lived and what language they spoke. 
1. Which two dynasties ruled Iran during this period?
During the period mentioned in the text, the two dynasties that ruled Iran were:
The Parthian Dynasty
The Sasanian Dynasty
2. What do you infer from the statement, “the Roman Empire was a mosaic of territories and cultures.” 
The statement “the Roman Empire was a mosaic of territories and cultures” suggests several key inferences:
 The Roman Empire encompassed a wide range of territories, each with its own distinct culture, traditions, and languages. This diversity was a result of the empire’s expansion and conquests, which incorporated various regions and their indigenous cultures.
 Despite the cultural diversity, the Roman Empire was held together by a common system of government. This administrative unity was crucial for the governance and stability of the empire. Latin and Greek were the primary languages used for administrative purposes.
 The use of Latin and Greek for administration suggests that the empire was divided linguistically, with the upper classes in the eastern provinces predominantly using Greek, while those in the western provinces primarily used Latin. The boundary between these linguistic regions was somewhere in the middle of the Mediterranean.
 Regardless of the cultural and linguistic diversity within the empire, all inhabitants were subjects of a single ruler, the emperor. This centralized authority was a defining feature of the Roman Empire, and the emperor’s rule extended across the various provinces and cultures.
 The mosaic of territories and cultures within the Roman Empire highlights the territorial integration achieved through conquest and governance. The empire’s ability to assimilate diverse regions into a unified political entity contributed to its longevity and influence.
3. Identify the two rival superpowers and state how they differed.
The two rival superpowers referred to in the text are:
The Roman Empire
The Iranian Empire (specifically the Parthian and Sasanian dynasties)
Differences between the two superpowers:
 As mentioned earlier, the Roman Empire was culturally diverse, consisting of various territories and cultures bound together by a common system of government. In contrast, the Iranian Empire, under both the Parthian and Sasanian dynasties, ruled over a population that was largely Iranian, resulting in a more homogenous cultural landscape.
 Latin and Greek were the primary languages used for administrative purposes in the Roman Empire, while in the Iranian Empire, the predominant language was Iranian.
 The Roman Empire extended across the Mediterranean region, encompassing parts of Europe, Asia, and Africa. In contrast, the Iranian Empire, especially during the Parthian and Sasanian periods, focused primarily on the Iranian Plateau and neighboring regions.
 The Roman Empire underwent significant religious transformations, including the spread of Christianity as a major faith. In contrast, the Iranian Empire had its own religious traditions, with Zoroastrianism being a prominent belief system.
 Both empires had centralized systems of government, but the specific structures and administrative practices differed. The Roman Empire was known for its Roman law and administrative hierarchy, while the Iranian Empire had its own administrative institutions and governance systems.
 The two superpowers often had conflicting interests and engaged in territorial disputes along their borders, especially in regions such as Mesopotamia.
33. Read the text carefully and answer the questions: 
The nobility had, in reality, a central role in social processes. This is because they controlled land. This control was the outcome of a practice called ‘vassalage’. The kings of France were linked to the people by ‘vassalage’, similar to the practice among the Germanic peoples, of whom the Franks were one. The big landowners – the nobles – were vassals of the king, and peasants were vassals of the landowners. A nobleman accepted the king as his seigneur (senior) and they made a mutual promise: the seigneur/lord would protect the vassal, who would be loyal to him. This relationship involved elaborate rituals and exchange of vows taken on the Bible in a church. At this ceremony, the vassal received a written charter or a staff or even a clod of earth as a symbol of the land that was being given to him by his master. The noble enjoyed a privileged status. He had absolute control over his property, in perpetuity. He could raise troops called ‘feudal levies’. The lord held his own courts of justice and could even coin his own money. He was the lord of all the people settled on his land. He owned vast tracts of land which contained his own dwellings, his private fields and pastures and the homes and fields of his tenant-peasants. His house was called a manor. His private lands were cultivated by peasants, who were also expected to act as footsoldiers in battle when required, in addition to working on their own farms.  
1. Examine the relationship between a vassal to his master or lord under the vassalage system.
 The vassalage system was a feudalistic social structure that defined the relationship between a vassal (typically a noble or landowner) and his master or lord. This system had several key features:
 The relationship was formalized through elaborate rituals and ceremonies, often conducted in a church. Both the vassal and the lord made solemn oaths of loyalty and mutual support. These oaths were considered sacred and were often taken on the Bible.
 As part of the ceremony, the lord granted land, known as a fief, to the vassal. This land was considered the vassal’s source of income and livelihood. It was symbolically represented by a written charter, a staff, or even a clod of earth.
 The lord pledged to protect and provide security to the vassal in times of need. In return, the vassal swore allegiance to the lord and promised to provide military service when called upon. This included raising troops for the lord’s defense.
 The vassalage system was hierarchical, with clear distinctions between the lord and the vassals. The lord was typically a higher-ranking noble or landowner, while vassals were often lesser nobles or knights. This hierarchy was based on landownership and social status.
 The noble vassal enjoyed certain privileges, such as absolute control over the land granted to them, the ability to hold their own courts of justice, and the authority to coin their own money. They were also the lords of the people settled on their land, including tenant-peasants who worked the land.
 Vassals were expected to serve as footsoldiers in battle when required by their lord. This military duty was a crucial aspect of the vassal-lord relationship and contributed to the lord’s defense and the maintenance of social order.
2. Trace the origin of the title lord within the nobility. 
The title “lord” within the nobility had its origins in the feudal system and the vassalage system. Here’s how the title evolved within the nobility:
 Feudalism was a system of landownership and social hierarchy that characterized medieval Europe. At the top of the feudal hierarchy were monarchs or kings, followed by high-ranking nobles, including dukes, counts, and barons.
 Nobles who controlled vast estates and territories were often referred to as lords. Their authority and power were closely tied to landownership, as they were responsible for governing their territories and providing protection to those who lived on their lands.
 The vassalage system formalized the relationship between lords and their vassals (lesser nobles or knights). The vassals pledged loyalty and service to their lords in exchange for land grants and protection. This system reinforced the authority of the lord as the master of the land.
 Over time, the term “lord” became a title of respect and authority associated with those who held significant land and had vassals or tenants under their control. It signified their position as the rulers of their domains and their responsibilities toward their subjects.
 The title “lord” was often hereditary, passed down from one generation to the next within noble families. It became a mark of lineage and social status within the nobility.
3. State two examples to show how the noble enjoyed a privileged status. 
Two examples illustrating the privileged status of nobles within the feudal system and vassalage system are:
 Nobles, including lords, had absolute control over their property, including vast tracts of land. They could manage and use these lands as they saw fit, which often included collecting rents and agricultural produce from tenant-peasants who worked on the land. This control over property contributed to the economic wealth and social status of the noble class.
 Nobles, especially lords, had the authority to raise and command their own troops known as “feudal levies.” This meant that they could maintain their private armies, ensuring their security and influence. This military authority also allowed them to participate actively in battles and wars when required, further solidifying their position of power within the feudal hierarchy.
34. On the given map of Australia, locate and label the given places.
Sydney
Adelaide
Melbourne
OR
Darwin
35. On the given map of Western Europe, three places have been marked as A and B which are associated with the extent of feudalism. Identify any two of them and write their correct names on the lines marked near them.

Given differential equation,
(x+dy/dx)

 = (dy/dx)
2
 +1
on simplifying,
x
2
 + (dy/dx)
2
 + 2x(dy/dx) = (dy/dx)
2
 + 1
Subtracting (dy/dx)
2
 from both sides we get,
x
2
 + 2x(dy/dx) = 1
Now,
Order of the above Differential Equation is 1
Degree of the above Differential Equation is 2
So the sum is 1+1 = 2
Given,
= 3i-2j+2k 
 = -i-2k
By triangular law of vector,
\vec{QS} = \vec{PS} – \vec{PQ}
                 = (-i-2k) – (3i-2j+2k)
                 =(-4i+2j-4k)
|QS| = (16+4+16)
1/2
 =(36)
1/2
=6.
Similarly,
+
=
=>(3i-2j+2k)+(-i-2k)
=(2i-2j)
|PR|=(4+4)
1/2
= (8)
1/2.

By using Method of substitution:
let,   tanx=t
Differentiating both sides with respect to x,
=>sec

Now, the equation is:

/3 – tanx + x + c
Now Putting the values into the equation:
F(x) = tan³x/3 – tan x + x+ c
=> F(π/4) = 1/3 – 1 + π/4 + c
=> π/4 = 1/3 – 1 + π/4 + c
=> xc = 1-1/3 = 2/3
F(x) = tan³x /3 – tan x + x + 2/3.
∫ log x – 3/(log x)

By using Method of substitution:
logx = t 
Differentiating both sides with respect to x,
1/x  = dt/dx
 dx= xdt                                                      [logx=t   => x=e

=>dx= e

=  x/(log x)3 +c                                         where, c=constant
We know that,
P(B/A)= P(A.B)/P(A)
P(A/B)=P(A.B)/P(B)
=>P(A.B)= P(A/B) × P(B)
=3/4 × 1/2
=3/8
So, P(B/A) = (3/8) / (5/8)
=3/5.
For X = No. of red balls is taken i.e., X = (BB),
P(X) = 3/5 × 2/4 
       = 6/20 = 3/10
For X = One Ball is red is taken i.e., X(BR, RB) 
P(X) = 3/5 × 2/4 + 2/5 × 3/4 
       = 6/20 + 6/20 = 12/20 = 3/5
For X = Both Red Balls are taken i.e., X(RR)
P(X) = 2/5 × 1/4 
       = 2/20 = 1/10

If a vector is non-zero then it has at least one non-zero component, a zero vector has all components as 0’s therefore no length.
Consider the LHS and RHS of the given
It more or less equivalent to the commutative law,
a-2d is parallel to 2b-c where a is not equal to 2d and c is not equal to 2b,
Here, we consider the following equation so as to get the value,
Vectors when multiplied in scalar in 1 and when
multiplied using vector becomes zero
Here,
We take example,
A×A = 0
Following the procedure in the sum for same,
We get,
a x b-a x c = c x d-b x d
=> ax(b-c)=(c-b) x d
=> ax(b-c)-(c-b) x d=0
⇒ ax(b-c)-dx(b−c) = 0
(a-d)x(b-c)=0
⇒ (a-d) || (b-c)
(a-d) (b-c)+0
a.b+d.c is not equal to d.b+ a.c
Hence, the required answer is a.b+d.c is not equal to d.b+ a.c
Let

r[i(2+2λ)+j(2+5λ)+k(−3+3λ)]=7+9λ
Taking r=xi+yj+zj
We get, 
(2+2λ)x+(2+5λ)y+(−3+3λ)z=7+9λ
(2x+2y−3z−7)+λ(2x+5y+3z−9)=0
Given, it passes through (2,1,3)

BY using Method of substitution:
Let, y=ux

 On Integrating both sides we get,

tan(y/x) + logx = C
C= Log1
Hence, tan(y/x) +logx= log1

The first chapter in Class 12 Physics is Electric Charges and Fields. In this chapter, electric charge is introduced once again to the students after class 9, but this time the study of charge is well-detailed and quite extensive. This chapter is the first chapter of electrostatics, i.e., the study of static charge, in which students study static charge and its various effects on other things, Coulomb’s law, and many more things, which are listed as follows:
Electric Charge 
Conductors and Insulators

Current Electricity is the third chapter of Class 12 Physics, which is an extension of the previous year’s classes on the same topic. Here, all the previously studied topics are again introduced but with very detailed explanations which help clear out the doubts of the previous year’s class where understanding of the current and electricity is very simple. In his chapter, we study not only the foundational topics but the further extension of electricity and various equipment related to it and study all the following topics:
Electric Current 
Electric Currents in Conductors 
Ohm’s Law 
Drift of Electrons

After the study of static charge, its natural continuation should be the study of moving charge i.e., Electrodynamics. Chapter 4 of class 12 physics introduces us to the study of electrodynamics, where we study moving charges and get to know that motion of charge (electricity) creates magnetism as well. This chapter introduces us to the various topic related to moving charge and magnetic field due to charge as well, and that is as follows:
Magnetic Force 
Motion in a Magnetic Field 
Motion in Combined Electric and Magnetic Fields 
Magnetic Field Due to a Current Element
Biot-savant Law

The Solenoid and the Toroid 
Force Between Two Parallel Currents Conductors
 
Torque on Current Loop, Magnetic Dipole 
The Moving Coil Galvanometer 
Chapter 5 deals with Magnetism as well but in a matter unlike chapter 4. In this chapter, we learn about the general concept of magnetism and the magnetism of matter. We also learn about the Magnetim of Earth (which is quite fascinating) and the various magnetic properties of materials. Other than this all the topics which this chapter covers are as follows:
Magnetism
Gauss’s Law of Magnetism
The Earth’s Magnetism 
Magnetisation and Magnetic Intensity 
Magnetic Properties of Materials 
Permanent Magnets and Electromagnets 
After understanding the magnetism of materials that surround us, it is only natural that we study electromagnetism (which in other words can be said synthetic magnetism as it is discovered by humans). In Chapter 6, we study the magnetism and magnetic field discovered and invented by humans. This chapter also introduces us to many scientists who have done marvellous work in the field of physics. Besides, we study the following topics:
Experiments of Faraday and Henry 
Magnetic Flux
 
Faraday’s Law of Induction 
Lenz’s Law and Conservation of Energy 
Motional Electromotive Force

Chapter 1: Rational Numbers
Any number that can be described in p/q form where q is not equal to zero is called a 
. A rational number is a kind of real number. Or in other words, Any fraction with non-zero denominators is a rational number. Examples of rational numbers are 1/2, 1/5, 3/4,  and so on. The number “0” is also a rational number, as we can define it in many forms such as 0/1, 0/2, 0/3, etc. But, 1/0, 2/0, 3/0, etc. are not rational, since they give us infinite values. 
In this chapter, you will learn more about Rational Numbers, the representation of rational numbers on the number line, and rational numbers between two rational numbers. To represent rational numbers on a number line, we need to streamline and write in the 
decimal form
 first.

For any rational numbers a, b, and c, 
: (a ⁄ b) × (b/a) = 1.
 a + (-a) = (-a) + a = 0.
a + b is also a rational number.
a × b is also a rational number.
 a + b = b + a.
(a × b) = (b × a).
(a + b) + c = a + (b + c).
(a x b) x c = a x (b x c).
 a × (b + c) = (a × b) +( a × c).
Chapter 2: Linear Equations in One Variable
A linear equation in one variable is represented as ax+b = 0, where a and b are integers and x is a variable with one solution. The unknown quantity is usually represented by ‘x’ in a linear equation. There are various basic approaches to solving a linear equation, such as isolating variables and constants on separate sides of the equation. 
In addition to addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, the chapter also covers other techniques for solving algebraic equations. To solve linear equations, one must learn to solve equations with variables on both sides and simplify equations

If SP = CP, then it is neither profit nor loss.
If CP > SP, then it is loss.
Discount = Marked Price – Sale Price
Discount % = Discount × 100 / MP
Profit Percentage = (Profit / Cost Price) × 100
Loss Percentage = (Loss / Cost Price) × 100
Percentage Increased = Change in Value / Original Value

Chapter 13: Direct and Inverse Proportions
This chapter gives a detailed explanation of inverse and direct proportions through word problems. Any two quantities a and b can be said to be in 
 if they variate (increase or decrease) together with each other in such a way that the ratio of their corresponding values remains the same. However, two quantities x and y are said to be in 
 
if an increase in x causes a proportional decrease in y (and vice-versa) in such a manner that the product of their corresponding values remains constant.
Relation to Direct Proportion
Relation for Inverse Proportion
is represented by the symbol ∝. For example, if we claim that p is proportional to q, this implies p ∝ q and if we say that p is inversely proportional to q, then this implies “
.” 
 If
, where k is any positive number, then a and b are said to be in direct proportion. e.g. If the number of things bought increases, then the total cost of purchase also increases.
If 
, then x and y are said to vary inversely. e.g. If the number of people increases, the time is taken to finish the food decreases. Or If the speed will increase the time required to cover a given distance will decrease.

Soft and Friable: It is soft, friable, and crumbly, which makes it easier to break apart and handle.
Sub-Bituminous: Lignite is classified as a sub-bituminous coal due to its lower carbon content and energy output compared to higher-ranked coals like bituminous or anthracite coal.
These features contribute to its use primarily in electricity generation and as a fuel source for power plants, where its lower energy content is acceptable.
15. Examine the political outcome of democracy. [3]
The political outcome of democracy is multifaceted. Democracy aims to provide political power to the people through elected representatives, ensuring citizens have a voice in governance. It promotes political stability, peaceful transitions of power, and accountability. However, challenges like populism, polarization, and inequities can arise. Democracy fosters pluralism, allowing diverse viewpoints and fostering debate. Yet, it requires strong institutions to function effectively. Overall, the political outcome of democracy is the empowerment of citizens, but its success depends on the quality of governance and the resilience of democratic institutions.
16. What are movement groups? Mention two types of movement groups. [3]
Movement groups are organizations or associations that are formed to advocate for specific social, political, or economic causes. They engage in collective action to bring about change in society. Two types of movement groups are:

20. What is WTO? Has it been successful in its objective? Explain. [3]
The WTO (World Trade Organization) is an international organization that regulates global trade. Its primary objective is to facilitate trade by reducing trade barriers and ensuring fair trade practices among member countries. It has succeeded in promoting trade liberalization, but opinions on its success vary. Critics argue that it benefits developed countries more than developing ones and can lead to inequalities. However, proponents believe it has contributed to global economic growth and dispute resolution. The WTO continues to be a subject of debate, with ongoing efforts to address its shortcomings and enhance its effectiveness.
21. Why were some leaders within the congress reluctant to start Non-cooperation Movement? Explain. [3]
Some leaders within the Congress were initially reluctant to start the Non-cooperation Movement because they were concerned about its radical nature and the potential for violence. They believed that nonviolent protests might not be effective and were worried about the consequences of mass mobilization. However, under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi, the movement gained momentum and ultimately garnered widespread support, leading to its adoption despite initial reservations.
22. “The Habsburg Empire that rules over Austria-Hungary was a patchwork of many different regions and peoples”. Support the statement with suitable examples. [5]
The Habsburg Empire, ruling Austria-Hungary, was a complex entity comprising various ethnic groups, including Germans, Hungarians, Czechs, Slovaks, Croats, and more. This diversity led to ethnic tensions and nationalist movements. For example, Czechs and Slovaks sought greater autonomy and later formed Czechoslovakia. Similarly, Hungarians desired more independence. These nationalistic aspirations ultimately contributed to the empire’s dissolution after World War I, leading to the emergence of independent nation-states based on ethnic identity. The patchwork nature of the empire made it challenging to govern cohesively and played a significant role in its eventual disintegration.
How did the Vietnamese use their limited resources to great advantage during the Vietnamese war in 1960s? Explain with examples.
During the Vietnam War in the 1960s, the North Vietnamese forces faced limited resources compared to the well-equipped American military. To compensate, they employed guerrilla warfare tactics, utilizing the dense jungles and tunnels of the Ho Chi Minh Trail to hide and launch surprise attacks. They also used minimal but effective weaponry like the AK-47 and improvised explosive devices (IEDs). The commitment of the Vietnamese people to their cause and their ability to adapt to adverse conditions played a crucial role. This resourcefulness and determination ultimately contributed to their successful resistance against a superior force, leading to the eventual reunification of Vietnam.
23. Iron and steel industry is called “basic and heavy industry”. Support the statement with arguments. [5]
The iron and steel industry is classified as a “basic and heavy industry” due to its fundamental role in industrialization. It is considered basic because it produces raw materials (iron and steel) for various other industries. It’s heavy because of the massive infrastructure required, including furnaces, mills, and transportation. Additionally, the industry demands substantial capital investment. Steel, a versatile material, is vital for construction, machinery, and infrastructure development. Its production is a key indicator of a country’s industrial progress. Given its critical role, governments often prioritize and support the development of the iron and steel sector in their industrialization efforts.
24. “India is fortunate to have fairly rich and varied mineral resources”. Elaborate the statement.
India is indeed fortunate to possess abundant and diverse mineral resources. The country is rich in minerals like coal, iron ore, bauxite, limestone, and more. This wealth of minerals has significant economic implications. For instance, coal and iron ore are crucial for the steel and power industries, while bauxite is vital for aluminum production. These resources not only contribute to industrial growth but also generate revenue through exports. Additionally, minerals play a key role in infrastructure development. India’s varied mineral wealth supports sectors like mining, manufacturing, and construction, fostering economic development and providing employment opportunities.
25. How do political parties shape public opinion? Explain. [5]
Political parties play a vital role in shaping public opinion through several means:
Campaigns and Propaganda: Parties run election campaigns and use propaganda to convey their ideologies, policies, and vision to the public. These campaigns influence public perception.
Media Engagement: Parties utilize the media to reach a wider audience, using news coverage, interviews, and advertisements to sway public opinion in their favor.
Public Discourse: Parties engage in debates, discussions, and rallies that frame issues and policies, impacting how people perceive political matters.
Policy Formulation: Parties develop policies that align with the preferences of their supporters, helping to mold public opinion on important issues.
Representation: Parties represent different sections of society, giving a voice to various interests and viewpoints, which can shape public opinion accordingly.
26. Explain any five major challenges to democracy in India.(5) 
Certainly, here are five major challenges to democracy in India:
: India’s high economic disparity can lead to unequal political influence, undermining the democratic principle of equal participation.
: Religious and caste-based tensions can polarize the electorate, posing a threat to social harmony and democratic values.
: Widespread corruption erodes trust in government institutions and hinders effective governance.
: The presence of criminals in politics can lead to compromised governance and undermine the democratic process.
: Limited access to education can hinder informed political participation, perpetuating a cycle of unequal representation.
27. Analyse the situations which lead to consumer exploitation.(5)
Consumer exploitation arises from various situations:
Information Asymmetry: When sellers possess more information than buyers, consumers may make uninformed decisions.
Monopoly Power: When a single seller controls a market, they can set prices and quality arbitrarily, leading to exploitation.
Deceptive Advertising: Misleading advertisements can manipulate consumers into buying products or services they don’t need.
Lack of Regulations: Weak consumer protection laws and enforcement can allow businesses to engage in unfair practices.
Price Gouging: During crises or shortages, sellers may charge exorbitant prices for essential goods.
28. What are transactions made in money? What were the shortcomings of the barter system [5]
Transactions made in money involve the exchange of goods and services using a universally accepted medium of exchange, like currency. Money facilitates economic activities by eliminating the limitations of barter systems. Shortcomings of barter systems include the double coincidence of wants (both parties must want what the other offers), impracticality for complex transactions, lack of a standard measure of value, and difficulties in storing wealth. Money overcomes these limitations, making trade and economic growth more efficient and accessible.

Radio waves are part of the electromagnetic spectrum and waves with one of the largest wavelengths. These waves are used for long-range communication as they are capable of propagating along the curvature of the earth. They are sent using the transmitter and are received using the antenna called the receiver. Radio waves are widely used for long-range communication and they operate in the range of 300 GHz to 3 kHz.
Radio waves are wave which is generated at the furthest end of the 
electromagnetic spectrum
 where the wavelength is highest they are transmitted using a radio transmitter and are received using a radio receiver. These waves can easily bend along the Earth’s curvature and are best suited for long-range communication. They do not get diffracted while travelling along the earth’s atmosphere. Similar to other 
electromagnetic waves
 radio waves also travel at the speed of light. They are generated by fast-accelerating electrons.
The image shows a man enjoying radio songs using radio waves.
Radio Waves Formula
The formula which gives the relation between the speed, wavelength, and frequency of the radio waves is discussed below,
where,
v
r 
is the speed,
λ is the wavelength, and
v is the frequency of the radio wave.
The concept of radio waves is explained by their speed formula. The speed of a radio wave is calculated by computing the product of its wavelength and frequency. 
It is denoted by the symbol v
r
. 
Its standard unit of measurement is meters per second (m/s). 
The dimensional formula of the speed of radio waves is given by [M

Discovery of Radio Waves
James Maxwell was the first person to tell us about the behaviour of radio waves by studying Maxwell’s equation for electromagnetic waves. After him, the experiments on radio waves were demonstrated by Heinrich Hertz but they fail to provide the practical application of the radio waves. Italian scientist Guglielmo Marconi was the first to provide the practical implementation of radio waves and he created the first radio for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1909. These waves were first used for commercial purposes in the 1900s. Radio waves are also called Hertzian waves.
Various objects in space emit radio waves as a part of their electromagnetic spectrum. The sun also emits radio waves which can be captured using radio telescopes which tells a lot about its structure, features, and others.
Wavelength of Radio Waves
The various wavelengths of the Radio waves are given in the following diagram.
Radio Propagation
Radio waves propagate through space by radiation. When an electrical charge is accelerated, it generates a changing magnetic field, which in turn generates a changing electric field. These changing fields combine to form an electromagnetic wave that propagates through space.
Radio waves can travel through a vacuum, which means they can travel through space without any medium. However, radio waves can also travel through other materials, such as air, water, and various solid objects. The ability of radio waves to travel through these materials depends on their frequency and wavelength.
Wavelength, Speed, and Frequency of Radiowaves
Radio waves travel at a speed similar to the speed of light. Wavelength is the distance between two successive crests of the radio waves. These waves have the highest wavelength among all electromagnetic waves and conversely have the lowest wavelength.
The frequency range of the radio wave is from 3 kHz to 300 GHz.
Types of Radio Waves
Radio waves are of various types and some of the most common types of waves are,
Shortwave Frequency Range of Radio Waves
Low to Medium Frequency Range of Radio Waves
Higher Frequency Range of Radio Waves
Highest Frequency Range of Radio Waves
Shortwave Frequency Range of Radio Waves
Short radio waves use frequencies that come under the HF band of radio waves band, their wavelength varies from 1.7 megahertz to 30 megahertz. Some of these waves are used for telecommunication services.
Low to Medium Frequency Range of Radio Waves
These are the waves with a range of 535 kilohertz to 1.7 megahertz they are among the shortest waves in the radio wave band. They can easily travel underwater and can easily penetrate the rocks and thus, are widely used in underwater purposes, submarines, and mining and geothermal activities.
Higher Frequency Range of Radio Waves
Under these categories come the ranges HF, VHF, and UHF that are used by FM radio, which are used to communicate, public radio service, cellphones, and GPS. Frequency Modulation techniques are widely used by these frequency ranges of radio waves. to encode their information.
These waves transfer the information with the least disturbance and are used to send communication signals.
Highest Frequency Range of Radio Waves
The highest frequency range of radio waves is the SHF and EHF. They have some features of microwaves. They have very limited application and are mostly used for scientific purposes.
Radio Communication
Radio communication is one of the prime use of radio waves the AM or FM radio stations uses radio waves. In these FM radio antennas are used to catch the radio waves sent by the radio transmitter which are placed at various locations in a city. Using these transistors and receivers we can directly communicate with thousands of people they are used to communicate public information, broadcast news, and send emergency distress signals.
Radio Waves Uses
Radio waves are widely used for a variety of purposes. Radio waves have the highest wavelength among all electromagnetic waves and they can easily penetrate the atmosphere and structure materials, and can also twist around blocks by diffraction various uses of radio waves are
Radio Communication is the most common use of radio waves they are used for communicating to a wide range of audiences at once.
Cellular Networks use radio technology for establishing networks.
RADAR uses radio technology.
Satellite Communication has a wide use of radio technology
Navigation and Air Traffic Control also use radio technology.

Regional and/or local government authorities.
As a part of our standard business practices, we may transfer your personal data to organisations based in countries that have not been granted an adequacy decision under the General Data Protection Regulation.
Where data is transferred to such countries, we shall ensure that specific safeguards or derogations have been established.
These might include where the data transfer is necessary in order to fulfil a contract between us and yourself, where we have received your specific consent after having made you aware of any risks involved, or where contracts are in place between us and the third-parties involved that ensure the recipient organisation has a suitable standard of data protection in place.
We will keep your personal data only for as long as required to achieve the purposes for which it was collected, in line with this privacy notice.
The following criteria are what determine the period for which we will keep your personal data:
Until we are no longer required to do so to comply with regulatory requirements or financial obligations.
Until we are no longer required to do so by any law we are subject to.
Until all purposes for which the data was originally gathered have become irrelevant or obsolete.
Until it has been requested that we no longer process the data and that it is erased; in some cases, where there is a remaining relevant or legal reason why we are required to keep this data, we may opt to restrict the amount of processing being conducted to what is absolutely necessary rather than erase it.
Data is retained for as long as an account stays active and it is then deleted within 15 days after the account is deleted.
There are several rights granted to you immediately upon providing us with your personal information; some of these are mentioned above. We’d like you to know that at Sanchhaya Education we take your rights seriously and will always conduct ourselves in a way that is considerate of our responsibility to serve your legal rights. 
This grants you the right to confirm whether or not your personal data is being processed, and to be provided with relevant details of what those processing operations are and what personal data of yours is being processed.
If you would like access to the personal data we have about you, we ask that you contact us using the details below.
This one is fairly straightforward; if you notice that the data we have about you is inaccurate or incomplete, you may request we rectify the mistake. We will make every effort to respond to requests of this type immediately.
Otherwise known as the ‘right to be forgotten’, this gives you the right to request your personal data be deleted.
This is not an absolute right; if you were to request that we erase your personal data, we would erase as much of that data as we could but may have to retain some information if it is necessary.
Where we have received a request for personal data to be erased, if it is necessary for us to retain some of that information we shall ensure that the remaining data is used only when and where it is absolutely necessary.
The right to object is a basic freedom all democracies enjoy. If you wish to object to the way we use, or have used, your personal data you may do so freely.
The Right to Portability
This is a legal right afforded to you that states we must pass on all of the details you have provided to us in a machine-readable format, either to your or to another provider of your choosing. 
We will always try to maintain the highest standards and encourage the confidence our customers have in us as an organisation. To achieve this, we request that any complaints be first brought to our attention so we can properly investigate matters. If you would like to complain about Sanchhaya Education to a regulatory body, you may do so by contacting your local data protection supervisory authority.

Computer networking is like having a group of friends who all have phones and can call or text each other. In computer networking, instead of phones, we have computers and instead of phone lines, we use cables, Wi-Fi, or other methods to connect them. When computers are connected to a network, they can share information and resources, like files, printers, and internet connections. This allows them to communicate with each other quickly and easily, just like friends talking on their phones.
A computer network consists of various kinds of nodes. Servers, networking hardware, personal computers, and other specialized or general-purpose hosts can all be nodes in a computer network. Hostnames and network addresses are used to identify them. In this article, we are going to discuss computer networking in detail.
What is a Computer Network?
A computer network is a system that connects many independent computers to share information (data) and resources. The integration of computers and other different devices allows users to communicate more easily. A computer network is a collection of two or more computer systems that are linked together. A network connection can be established using either 
cable
 or 
wireless media.
 Hardware and software are used to connect computers and tools in any network.
What Do Computer Networks Do?
Computer Networks are one of the important aspects of Computer Science. In the early days, it is used for data transmission on
 telephone lines
 and had a very limited use, but nowadays, it is used in a variety of places.
Computer Networks help in providing better connectivity that helps nowadays. Modern computer networks have the following functionality:
Computer Networks help in operating virtually
Computer Networks integrate on a large scale
Computer Networks respond very quickly in case of conditions change
Computer Networks help in providing data security
In simple terms, a computer network is made up of two main parts: devices (called nodes) and connections (called links). The links connect the devices to each other. The rules for how these connections send information are called communication protocols. The starting and ending points of these communications are often called ports
Basic hardware interconnecting network nodes, such as Network Interface Cards (NICs), Bridges, Hubs, Switches, and Routers, are used in all networks. In addition, a mechanism for connecting these building parts is necessary, which is usually galvanic cable and optical cable are less popular (“optical fiber”)The following are the network devices :
A network card, often known as a network adapter or 
NIC
 (network interface card), is computer hardware that enables computers to communicate via a network. It offers physical access to networking media and, in many cases, 
MAC
 addresses serve as a low-level addressing scheme. Each
 network interface
 card has a distinct identifier. This is stored on a chip that is attached to the card.
A 
repeater
 is an electrical device that receives a signal, cleans it of unwanted noise, regenerates it, and retransmits it at a higher power level or to the opposite side of an obstruction, allowing the signal to travel greater distances without degradation. In the majority of twisted pair Ethernet networks, Repeaters are necessary for cable lengths longer than 100 meters in some systems. Repeaters are based on physics.
A 
hub
 is a device that joins together many twisted pairs or fiber optic Ethernet devices to give the illusion of a formation of a single network segment. The device can be visualized as a multiport repeater. A network hub is a relatively simple broadcast device. Any packet entering any port is regenerated and 
broadcast
 out on all other ports, and hubs do not control any of the traffic that passes through them. Packet collisions occur as a result of every packet being sent out through all other ports, substantially impeding the smooth flow of communication.
Bridges
 broadcast data to all the ports but not to the one that received the transmission. Bridges, on the other hand, learn which MAC addresses are reachable through specific ports rather than copying messages to all ports as hubs do. Once a port and an address are associated, the bridge will only transport traffic from that address to that port.
A switch differs from a hub in that it only forwards frames to the ports that are participating in the communication, rather than all of the ports that are connected. The collision domain is broken by a switch, yet the switch depicts itself as a broadcast domain. Frame-forwarding decisions are made by switches based on MAC addresses.
Routers are networking devices that use headers and forwarding tables to find the optimal way to forward data packets between networks. A router is a computer networking device that links two or more computer networks and selectively exchanges data packets between them. A router can use address information in each data packet to determine if the source and destination are on the same network or if the data packet has to be transported between networks. When numerous routers are deployed in a wide collection of interconnected networks, the routers share target system addresses so that each router can develop a table displaying the preferred pathways between any two systems on the associated networks.
To provide system compatibility, a 
gateway
 may contain devices such as protocol translators, impedance-matching devices, rate converters, fault isolators, or signal translators. It also necessitates the development of administrative procedures that are acceptable to both networks. By completing the necessary protocol conversions, a protocol translation/mapping gateway joins networks that use distinct network protocol technologies.
Links are the ways information travels between devices, and they can be of two types:
Communication done in a wired medium
 Copper wire, twisted pair, or fiber optic cables are all options. A wired network employs wires to link devices to the Internet or another network, such as laptops or desktop PCs.
Wireless means without wire, media that is made up of electromagnetic waves (EM Waves) or infrared waves. Antennas or sensors will be present on all wireless devices.  For data or voice communication, a wireless network uses radio frequency waves rather than wires.
A communication protocol is a set of rules that all devices follow when they share information. Some common protocols are TCP/IP, IEEE 802, Ethernet, wireless LAN, and cellular standards. TCP/IP is a model that organizes how communication works in modern networks. It has four functional layers for these communication links:
: This layer controls how data is physically transferred, including how hardware sends data through wires or fibers.
: This layer packages data into understandable packets and ensures it can be sent and received.
: This layer keeps the communication between devices steady and reliable.
: This layer allows high-level applications to access the network to start data transfer.
Most of the modern internet structure is based on the TCP/IP model, although the similar seven-layer OSI model still has a strong influence.
IEEE 802 is a group of standards for local area networks (LAN) and metropolitan area networks (MAN). The most well-known member of the IEEE 802 family is wireless LAN, commonly known as WLAN or Wi-Fi.
While nodes, links, and protocols are the building blocks of a network, a modern network also needs strong defenses. Security is crucial because huge amounts of data are constantly being created, moved, and processed. Some examples of network defense tools are firewalls, intrusion detection systems (
IDS
), intrusion prevention systems (
IPS
), network access control (
NAC
), content filters, proxy servers, anti-DDoS devices, and load balancers.
How Does a Computer Network Work?
Computer Networks simply work using nodes and links. Data communication equipment is simply termed as Nodes. For example, 
Modems
, Hubs, Switches, etc. whereas links in Computer networks can be referred to as a connection between two nodes. We have several types of links like cable wires, 
optical fibers
, etc. 
Whenever a Computer Network is working, nodes have the work of sending and receiving data via the links. Computer Network provides some set of protocols that help in following the rules and protocols.
It can be measured in many ways, including transmit time and response time. Transit time is the amount of time required for a message to travel from one device to another. Response time is the elapsed time between an inquiry and a response. The performance of the network depends on a number of factors, including the number of users, the type of medium & Hardware.
In addition to accuracy is measured by frequency of failure, the time it takes a link to recover from failure, and the network’s robustness in catastrophe. 
 Network security issues include protecting data from unauthorized access, protecting data from damage and development, and implementing policies and procedures for recovery from breaches and data loss.  
Programs do not have to execute on a single system because of resource and load sharing
Reduced costs – Multiple machines can share printers, tape drives, and other peripherals
Reliability – If one machine fails, another can take its place
Scalability (it’s simple to add more processors or computers)
Communication and mail (people living apart can work together)
Information Access (remote information access, access to the internet, e-mail, video conferencing, and online shopping)
Entertainment that is interactive (online games, videos, etc.)

Types of Computer Networks
 A 
LAN
 is a network that covers an area of around 10 kilometers. For example, a college network or an office network. Depending upon the needs of the organization, a LAN can be a single office, building, or Campus. We can have two PCs and one printer in-home office or it can extend throughout the company and include audio and video devices. Each host in LAN has an identifier, an address that defines hosts in LAN. A packet sent by the host to another host carries both the source host’s and the destination host’s address.
MAN
 refers to a network that covers an entire city. For example: consider the cable television network.
 
WAN
 refers to a network that connects countries or continents. For example, the Internet allows users to access a distributed system called www from anywhere around the globe.WAN interconnects connecting devices such as switches, routers, or modems. A LAN is normally privately owned by an organization that uses it. We see two distinct examples of WANs today: point-to-point WANs and Switched WANs 
: Connects two connecting devices through transmission media. 
 A switched WAN is a network with more than two ends.
 Point-to-Point networking
 is a type of data networking that establishes a direct link between two networking nodes.
A direct link between two devices, such as a computer and a printer, is known as a point-to-point connection.
: is the one in which more than two specific devices share links. In the multipoint environment, the capacity of the channel is shared, either spatially or temporally. If several devices can use the link simultaneously, it is a spatially shared connection. 
In
 broadcast networks
, a signal method in which numerous parties can hear a single sender. Radio stations are an excellent illustration of the “Broadcast Network” in everyday life. The radio station is a sender of data/signal in this scenario, and data is only intended to travel in one direction. Away from the radio transmission tower, to be precise.
Computers with similar capabilities and configurations are referred to as peers.
The “peers” in a
 peer-to-peer
 network are computer systems that are connected to each other over the Internet. Without the use of a central server, files can be shared directly between systems on the network.
Each computer or process on the network is either a client or a server in a client-server architecture (client/server). The client asks for services from the server, which the server provides. Servers are high-performance computers or processes that manage disc drives (file servers), printers (print servers), or network traffic (network servers)
The hybrid model  uses a combination of client-server and peer-to-peer architecture. Eg: Torrent.
Types of Computer Network Architecture
Computer Network Architecture is of two types. These types are mentioned below.
Client-Server Architecture
 is basically the architecture where the clients and the server are connected as two clients can communicate with each other and the devices present work as servers in the network.
Peer-to-Peer Architecture
, computers are connected to each other and each computer is equally capable of working as there is no central server here. Each device present here can be used as a client or server.
Types of Enterprise Computer Networks
There are three main types of Enterprise Computer Networks which are mentioned below.
Local Area Networks
 are small-scale networks used in small companies or as test networks. It has a limited size.
Wide Area Networks
 are networks that are used for a larger area than local area networks and are used for long-distance communication.
Service Provider Networks are the networks that help in wireless communication, high-speed internet access, etc.
No industry—whether it’s education, retail, finance, tech, government, or healthcare—can function without well-designed computer networks. The larger the organization, the more complex the network becomes. Before starting the challenging job of creating and setting up a computer network, here are some key objectives to consider.
Today’s enterprises are spread across the globe, with critical assets being shared across departments, geographies, and time zones. Clients are no more bound by location. A network allows data and hardware to be accessible to every pertinent user. This also helps with interdepartmental data processing. For example, the marketing team analyzes customer data and product development cycles to enable executive decisions at the top level.
A network ensures that resources are not stuck in isolated areas and can be accessed from multiple locations. High reliability comes from having various sources of supply. Important resources are backed up across multiple machines, so they remain accessible even if there are hardware problems.
As a company grows, its workload increases. Adding one or more processors to the network boosts the overall performance of the system and allows it to handle this growth. Storing data in well-designed databases can significantly speed up searching and retrieving information.
Big mainframe computers are costly, so it’s smarter to add processors strategically throughout the system. This boosts performance and saves money. Networks let employees access information quickly, saving operational time and costs. Centralized network administration means fewer investments are needed for IT support
Network-attached storage devices are great for employees who handle lots of data. For instance, the data science team doesn’t each need their own data storage for the large number of records they process. Centralized repositories are more efficient. As businesses deal with record amounts of customer data, the ability to expand storage capacity is crucial
Networks greatly influence how companies operate daily. Employees can share files, see each other’s work, sync calendars, and exchange ideas more efficiently. Internal messaging systems like Slack facilitate easy flow of information and conversations within modern enterprises. However, emails remain the formal mode of communication with clients, partners, and vendors.
Networks decrease errors by ensuring everyone gets information from one source, even if they’re in different places. 
Backed-up 
data ensures consistency and continuity. Standard versions of customer and employee manuals can be easily accessed by many people without much trouble
Computer networks offer flexibility, which is crucial during uncertain times like now when natural disasters and pandemics are affecting the world. A secure network guarantees that users can access and work on sensitive data safely, even when they’re not at the company’s location. Mobile devices registered to the network can also provide multiple layers of authentication, ensuring that unauthorized users can’t access the system.
What is Network Topology?
The structure of the network and how each component is connected to the others are defined by the network topology. Different types of network topology are mentioned below:
Bus Topology
Ring Topology
Star Topology
Mesh Topology
Tree Topology
Every computer and network device is connected to a single cable in a 
bus topology
 network. Linear Bus topology is defined as having exactly two terminals.
Installation is simple
Compared to mesh, star, and tree topologies, the bus utilizes less cabling
Difficulty in reconfiguring and isolating faults
A bus cable malfunction or break interrupts all communication
For more, you can refer to the 
Advantages and Disadvantages of Bus Topology.
The topology is named ring topology because one computer is connected to another, with the final one being connected to the first. Exactly two neighbors for each device. A signal is passed along the ring in one direction. Each ring incorporates a repeater. 
Data transmission is relatively straightforward because packets only move in one direction
There is no requirement for a central controller to manage communication between nodes
Easy installation & Reconfiguration
Simplified Faulty connections
In a Unidirectional Ring, a data packet must traverse through all nodes
All computers must be turned on in order for them to connect with one another
For more, you can refer to the 
Advantages and Disadvantages of Ring Topology.
Each device in a star topology has a dedicated point-to-point link to a central controller, which is commonly referred to as the HUB. There is no direct connection between the devices. Traffic between the devices is not allowed in this topology. As an exchange, the controller is used.
When attaching or disconnecting devices, there are no network interruptions
It’s simple to set up and configure
Identifying and isolating faults is simple
Less Expensive than mesh 
Easy to install & configure
Nodes attached to the hub, switch, or concentrator is failed if they fail
Because of the expense of the hubs, it is more expensive than linear bus topologies
More cable is required compared to a bus or ring 
Too much dependency on Hub
For more, you can refer to the
 Advantages and Disadvantages of Star Topology
.
 Used in high-speed LANs
Every device in a mesh topology has dedicated point-to-point connectivity to every other device. The term “dedicated” refers to the fact that the link exclusively transports data between the two devices it links. To connect n devices, a fully connected mesh network contains n *(n-1)/2 physical channels.
Data can be sent from multiple devices at the same time. This topology can handle a lot of traffic.
Even if one of the connections fails, a backup is always available. As a result, data transit is unaffected.
Physical boundaries prevent other users from gaining access to messages.
Point to Point links make fault transmission & fault isolation easy.
The amount of cabling and the number of I/O ports that are necessary.
The sheer bulk of wiring can be greater than the available space can accommodate.
It is difficult to install and reconfigure.
For more, you can refer to the 
Advantages and Disadvantages of Mesh Topology
.
  connection of telephone regional office in which each regional office needs to be connected to every other regional office. 
The topology of a tree is similar to that of a star. Nodes in a tree, like those in a star, are connected to a central hub that manages network traffic. It has a root node, which is connected to all other nodes, producing a hierarchy. Hierarchical topology is another name for it. The number of Star networks is connected via Bus in Tree Topology.
Network expansion is both possible and simple.
We partition the entire network into pieces (star networks) that are easier to manage and maintain.
Other segments are unaffected if one segment is damaged.
Tree topology relies largely on the main bus cable because of its basic structure, and if it fails, the entire network is handicapped.
Maintenance becomes more challenging when more nodes and segments are added.
For more, you can refer to the 
Advantages and Disadvantages of Tree Topology
.
What is Internet?
The Internet is a larger network that allows computer networks controlled by enterprises, governments, colleges, and other organizations all over the world to communicate with one another. As a result, there is a tangle of cables, computers, data centers, 
routers
, servers, repeaters, 
satellites
, and Wi-Fi towers that allow digital data to go around the world.
The Internet is a vast network of networks that functions as a networking infrastructure. It links millions of computers throughout the world, creating a network in which any computer can talk with any other computer as long as they are both linked to the Internet. The Internet is a global network of interconnected computers that communicate and share information using a standardized
 Internet Protocol
 Suite.
We can connect to the internet in the following ways:
 In order to access the Internet, in this type of connection, users must connect their phone line to a computer. This link prevents the user from using tier home phone service to make or receive calls.
 Broadband is a high-speed internet connection that is frequently utilized nowadays and is provided by 
cable
 or phone companies.
 Internet access is accomplished by 
radio waves
, thus it is possible to connect to the Internet from any location. 
Wi-Fi 
and mobile service providers are examples of wireless connections.
Advantages of the Internet 
 Online gaming, talking, browsing, music, movies, dramas, and TV series are quickly becoming the most popular ways to pass the time.
 There is no better place to conduct research than the internet. We can learn about the latest trends, communicate with experts without having to physically visit them, and seek professional advice over the Internet.
 With the advancement of internet technology, large online 
E-commerce 
enterprises such as Amazon, Ali Baba, myntra, etc. have emerged.
Working from home, collaborating with others, and having access to a global workforce are all advantages.
 Because there are hundreds of thousands of newsgroups and services that keep you updated with every tick of the clock, the Internet is a source of the most recent news.
Disadvantages of the Internet 
 Most people believe that spending too much time on the 
internet
 is unhealthy for young people and leads to obesity. 
 Aside from reputable sites, there are some 
Social Media Advertising
 sites that try to steal your personal information, credit card information, and even your pin code. You can easily become a victim of money scams if they get this information.
 It is now quite easy to decipher someone’s chat or email communication thanks to the hacking community. As we all know, data is transmitted in packets, which hackers can simply detect and reconstruct.
 Bullies exist online, just as they do in real life, and they can lower your self-esteem by harassing and threatening you. Some of these individuals may be persons who are aware of some of your personal details and dislike you and may use this information to harass you.
Conclusion
In conclusion, computer networking is essential because it allows computers to connect and communicate with each other. This connectivity enables them to share information and resources, making tasks easier and faster. Whether it’s a small network within a home or office (
LAN
) or a large network spreading across cities and countries (
WAN
), networking helps us stay connected, work together, and access the internet. It’s like having a team where everyone can instantly share ideas and tools, making collaboration smooth and efficient. So, computer networking is all about making connections that help us stay informed, productive, and connected to the world.

Computer networking is like having a group of friends who all have phones and can call or text each other. In computer networking, instead of phones, we have computers and instead of phone lines, we use cables, Wi-Fi, or other methods to connect them. When computers are connected to a network, they can share information and resources, like files, printers, and internet connections. This allows them to communicate with each other quickly and easily, just like friends talking on their phones.
A computer network consists of various kinds of nodes. Servers, networking hardware, personal computers, and other specialized or general-purpose hosts can all be nodes in a computer network. Hostnames and network addresses are used to identify them. In this article, we are going to discuss computer networking in detail.
What is a Computer Network?
A computer network is a system that connects many independent computers to share information (data) and resources. The integration of computers and other different devices allows users to communicate more easily. A computer network is a collection of two or more computer systems that are linked together. A network connection can be established using either 
cable
 or 
wireless media.
 Hardware and software are used to connect computers and tools in any network.
What Do Computer Networks Do?
Computer Networks are one of the important aspects of Computer Science. In the early days, it is used for data transmission on
 telephone lines
 and had a very limited use, but nowadays, it is used in a variety of places.
Computer Networks help in providing better connectivity that helps nowadays. Modern computer networks have the following functionality:
Computer Networks help in operating virtually
Computer Networks integrate on a large scale
Computer Networks respond very quickly in case of conditions change
Computer Networks help in providing data security
In simple terms, a computer network is made up of two main parts: devices (called nodes) and connections (called links). The links connect the devices to each other. The rules for how these connections send information are called communication protocols. The starting and ending points of these communications are often called ports
Basic hardware interconnecting network nodes, such as Network Interface Cards (NICs), Bridges, Hubs, Switches, and Routers, are used in all networks. In addition, a mechanism for connecting these building parts is necessary, which is usually galvanic cable and optical cable are less popular (“optical fiber”)The following are the network devices :
A network card, often known as a network adapter or 
NIC
 (network interface card), is computer hardware that enables computers to communicate via a network. It offers physical access to networking media and, in many cases, 
MAC
 addresses serve as a low-level addressing scheme. Each
 network interface
 card has a distinct identifier. This is stored on a chip that is attached to the card.
A 
repeater
 is an electrical device that receives a signal, cleans it of unwanted noise, regenerates it, and retransmits it at a higher power level or to the opposite side of an obstruction, allowing the signal to travel greater distances without degradation. In the majority of twisted pair Ethernet networks, Repeaters are necessary for cable lengths longer than 100 meters in some systems. Repeaters are based on physics.
A 
hub
 is a device that joins together many twisted pairs or fiber optic Ethernet devices to give the illusion of a formation of a single network segment. The device can be visualized as a multiport repeater. A network hub is a relatively simple broadcast device. Any packet entering any port is regenerated and 
broadcast
 out on all other ports, and hubs do not control any of the traffic that passes through them. Packet collisions occur as a result of every packet being sent out through all other ports, substantially impeding the smooth flow of communication.
Bridges
 broadcast data to all the ports but not to the one that received the transmission. Bridges, on the other hand, learn which MAC addresses are reachable through specific ports rather than copying messages to all ports as hubs do. Once a port and an address are associated, the bridge will only transport traffic from that address to that port.
A switch differs from a hub in that it only forwards frames to the ports that are participating in the communication, rather than all of the ports that are connected. The collision domain is broken by a switch, yet the switch depicts itself as a broadcast domain. Frame-forwarding decisions are made by switches based on MAC addresses.
Routers are networking devices that use headers and forwarding tables to find the optimal way to forward data packets between networks. A router is a computer networking device that links two or more computer networks and selectively exchanges data packets between them. A router can use address information in each data packet to determine if the source and destination are on the same network or if the data packet has to be transported between networks. When numerous routers are deployed in a wide collection of interconnected networks, the routers share target system addresses so that each router can develop a table displaying the preferred pathways between any two systems on the associated networks.
To provide system compatibility, a 
gateway
 may contain devices such as protocol translators, impedance-matching devices, rate converters, fault isolators, or signal translators. It also necessitates the development of administrative procedures that are acceptable to both networks. By completing the necessary protocol conversions, a protocol translation/mapping gateway joins networks that use distinct network protocol technologies.
Links are the ways information travels between devices, and they can be of two types:
Communication done in a wired medium
 Copper wire, twisted pair, or fiber optic cables are all options. A wired network employs wires to link devices to the Internet or another network, such as laptops or desktop PCs.
Wireless means without wire, media that is made up of electromagnetic waves (EM Waves) or infrared waves. Antennas or sensors will be present on all wireless devices.  For data or voice communication, a wireless network uses radio frequency waves rather than wires.

: This layer keeps the communication between devices steady and reliable.
: This layer allows high-level applications to access the network to start data transfer.
Most of the modern internet structure is based on the TCP/IP model, although the similar seven-layer OSI model still has a strong influence.
IEEE 802 is a group of standards for local area networks (LAN) and metropolitan area networks (MAN). The most well-known member of the IEEE 802 family is wireless LAN, commonly known as WLAN or Wi-Fi.

The structure of the network and how each component is connected to the others are defined by the network topology. Different types of network topology are mentioned below:
Bus Topology
Ring Topology
Star Topology
Mesh Topology
Tree Topology
Every computer and network device is connected to a single cable in a 
bus topology
 network. Linear Bus topology is defined as having exactly two terminals.
Installation is simple
Compared to mesh, star, and tree topologies, the bus utilizes less cabling
Difficulty in reconfiguring and isolating faults
A bus cable malfunction or break interrupts all communication
For more, you can refer to the 
Advantages and Disadvantages of Bus Topology.
The topology is named ring topology because one computer is connected to another, with the final one being connected to the first. Exactly two neighbors for each device. A signal is passed along the ring in one direction. Each ring incorporates a repeater. 
Data transmission is relatively straightforward because packets only move in one direction
There is no requirement for a central controller to manage communication between nodes
Easy installation & Reconfiguration
Simplified Faulty connections
In a Unidirectional Ring, a data packet must traverse through all nodes
All computers must be turned on in order for them to connect with one another
For more, you can refer to the 
Advantages and Disadvantages of Ring Topology.
Each device in a star topology has a dedicated point-to-point link to a central controller, which is commonly referred to as the HUB. There is no direct connection between the devices. Traffic between the devices is not allowed in this topology. As an exchange, the controller is used.
When attaching or disconnecting devices, there are no network interruptions
It’s simple to set up and configure
Identifying and isolating faults is simple
Less Expensive than mesh 
Easy to install & configure
Nodes attached to the hub, switch, or concentrator is failed if they fail
Because of the expense of the hubs, it is more expensive than linear bus topologies
More cable is required compared to a bus or ring 
Too much dependency on Hub
For more, you can refer to the
 Advantages and Disadvantages of Star Topology
.
 Used in high-speed LANs
Every device in a mesh topology has dedicated point-to-point connectivity to every other device. The term “dedicated” refers to the fact that the link exclusively transports data between the two devices it links. To connect n devices, a fully connected mesh network contains n *(n-1)/2 physical channels.
Data can be sent from multiple devices at the same time. This topology can handle a lot of traffic.
Even if one of the connections fails, a backup is always available. As a result, data transit is unaffected.
Physical boundaries prevent other users from gaining access to messages.
Point to Point links make fault transmission & fault isolation easy.
The amount of cabling and the number of I/O ports that are necessary.
The sheer bulk of wiring can be greater than the available space can accommodate.
It is difficult to install and reconfigure.
For more, you can refer to the 
Advantages and Disadvantages of Mesh Topology
.
  connection of telephone regional office in which each regional office needs to be connected to every other regional office. 
The topology of a tree is similar to that of a star. Nodes in a tree, like those in a star, are connected to a central hub that manages network traffic. It has a root node, which is connected to all other nodes, producing a hierarchy. Hierarchical topology is another name for it. The number of Star networks is connected via Bus in Tree Topology.
Network expansion is both possible and simple.
We partition the entire network into pieces (star networks) that are easier to manage and maintain.
Other segments are unaffected if one segment is damaged.
Tree topology relies largely on the main bus cable because of its basic structure, and if it fails, the entire network is handicapped.
Maintenance becomes more challenging when more nodes and segments are added.
For more, you can refer to the 
Advantages and Disadvantages of Tree Topology
.
What is Internet?
The Internet is a larger network that allows computer networks controlled by enterprises, governments, colleges, and other organizations all over the world to communicate with one another. As a result, there is a tangle of cables, computers, data centers, 
routers
, servers, repeaters, 
satellites
, and Wi-Fi towers that allow digital data to go around the world.
The Internet is a vast network of networks that functions as a networking infrastructure. It links millions of computers throughout the world, creating a network in which any computer can talk with any other computer as long as they are both linked to the Internet. The Internet is a global network of interconnected computers that communicate and share information using a standardized
 Internet Protocol
 Suite.
We can connect to the internet in the following ways:
 In order to access the Internet, in this type of connection, users must connect their phone line to a computer. This link prevents the user from using tier home phone service to make or receive calls.
 Broadband is a high-speed internet connection that is frequently utilized nowadays and is provided by 
cable
 or phone companies.
 Internet access is accomplished by 
radio waves
, thus it is possible to connect to the Internet from any location. 
Wi-Fi 
and mobile service providers are examples of wireless connections.
Advantages of the Internet 
 Online gaming, talking, browsing, music, movies, dramas, and TV series are quickly becoming the most popular ways to pass the time.
 There is no better place to conduct research than the internet. We can learn about the latest trends, communicate with experts without having to physically visit them, and seek professional advice over the Internet.
 With the advancement of internet technology, large online 
E-commerce 
enterprises such as Amazon, Ali Baba, myntra, etc. have emerged.
Working from home, collaborating with others, and having access to a global workforce are all advantages.
 Because there are hundreds of thousands of newsgroups and services that keep you updated with every tick of the clock, the Internet is a source of the most recent news.
Disadvantages of the Internet 
 Most people believe that spending too much time on the 
internet
 is unhealthy for young people and leads to obesity. 
 Aside from reputable sites, there are some 
Social Media Advertising
 sites that try to steal your personal information, credit card information, and even your pin code. You can easily become a victim of money scams if they get this information.
 It is now quite easy to decipher someone’s chat or email communication thanks to the hacking community. As we all know, data is transmitted in packets, which hackers can simply detect and reconstruct.
 Bullies exist online, just as they do in real life, and they can lower your self-esteem by harassing and threatening you. Some of these individuals may be persons who are aware of some of your personal details and dislike you and may use this information to harass you.
Conclusion
In conclusion, computer networking is essential because it allows computers to connect and communicate with each other. This connectivity enables them to share information and resources, making tasks easier and faster. Whether it’s a small network within a home or office (
LAN
) or a large network spreading across cities and countries (
WAN
), networking helps us stay connected, work together, and access the internet. It’s like having a team where everyone can instantly share ideas and tools, making collaboration smooth and efficient. So, computer networking is all about making connections that help us stay informed, productive, and connected to the world.
Frequently Asked Questions on Computer Networking – FAQs

In computer network there are various 
topologies
 available. A Bus Topology is one of them. All of the devices in a bus topology network are linked together by a single cable, which is referred to as a “bus” and the cable is known as backbone cable. All of the network’s devices can simultaneously receive the same signal due to the shared communication medium provided by this connection. In this article, we are going to discuss what is bus topology and its various applications, advantages, and disadvantages. 
What is Bus Topology?
 carries transmitted data through the cable because data reaches each node, the node checks the destination address (MAC/IP address) to determine if it matches their address. If the address does not match with the node, the node does nothing more. But if the addresses of nodes match to addresses contained within the data then they process knowledge. In the bus, communication between nodes is done through a foremost network cable.
Key Features of Bus Topology
An efficient bus architecture is established, and each station is connected by a single backbone cable. 
There are two requirements: Initially, the nodes are connected to the backbone cable directly, or they use a drop cable to help them connect.
The well-known access method for bus topologies is called 
CSMA
 (Carrier Sense Multiple Access). 
Best Practice for Designing Bus Topology
Plan for the network’s future growth and expansion. Ensure that the bus topology can accommodate extra devices with out extensively affecting overall performance. 
Create a good cabling setup for the bus backbone. Ensure that the cable is properly shielded to minimize sign interference and degradation. Use cable with suitable bandwidth and make certain that it meets the necessities of the network.
 Think about adding redundancy to decrease the risk of a single point of failure (SPoF). 
Terminate both ends of the bus with terminators to prevent signal reflection and ensure signal integrity. Improper termination can result in signal degradation and performance issues.
It is the easiest network topology for linearly connecting peripherals or computers.
It works very efficiently well when there is a small network.
The length of cable required is less than a star topology.
It is easy to connect or remove devices in this network without affecting any other device.
Very cost-effective as compared to other network topology i.e. mesh and star
It is easy to understand topology.
Easy to expand by joining the two cables together.
Bus topology is not good for large networks.
Identification of problems becomes difficult if the whole network goes down.
Troubleshooting individual device issues is very hard.
Need terminators are required at both ends of the main cable.
Additional devices slow the network down.
If the main cable is damaged, the whole network fails or splits into two.
Packet loss is high.
This network topology is very slow as compared to other 
topologies
.
Applications of Bus Topology
 Bus topology was traditionally utilized in Ethernet 
LANs
, mainly in older implementations wherein 
coaxial cables
 have been daisy-chained to connect computer systems.
 In industrial control system, bus topology is frequently used for connecting sensors, actuators, and different devices in distributed manipulate systems. 
 Bus topology is appropriate for connecting devices, meters, and records acquisition gadgets in laboratory or commercial environments.
 Bus topology is employed in building automation and HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) structures to attach sensors, thermostats, actuators, and other manage devices.
: Bus topology has traditionally been utilized in telephone networks and early records transmission systems. However, it has largely been changed by using more superior topologies like mesh or ring for telecommunications applications because of higher fault tolerance and scalability.
Data Transmission in Bus Topology
In a bus topology, data transmission takes place along a single backbone cable, known as the bus. The process of sending data in this particular network setup can be dissected in the following manner:
A single backbone cable links all devices (nodes) and serves as a shared communication medium.
 When a device needs to send data, it sends data bidirectionally along the bus. Data sent by any node is transmit to all other nodes in the network.
 While transmission in bus topology, each node analyzes the data destination address to determine if it is the designated receiver. If the node’s address matches the destination address, the data is processed by the node, Otherwise, the data is ignored.
The bus being shared by all nodes increases the probabilty of data collisions when two devices transmit at the same time. In the majority of bus topologies, a technique such as Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (
CSMA/CD
) is implemented to handle collisions. 
CSMA/CD
 requires that devices supervise the bus to verify its availability before transmitting data and to recognize and handle collisions if they happen.
Types of Cables Used in Bus Topology
Common cable types used in bus topology include 
coaxial cable
 and 
twisted-pair cable
. 
Can Multiple Bus Topologies be Connected Together?
Yes, It is possible to connect multiple bus topologies together, but it’s important to make sure the reliability and performance of the network. Following are the methods to connect multiple bus topologies:
 We can connect multiple bus topologies linearly, where the end of one bus becomes part of another, akin to chaining several buses together. Each part is connected at its ends, allowing devices on different parts to communicate.
 To increase the length of a bus and connect multiple parts, repeaters or amplifiers can be utilized. These devices regenerate the signal to prevent damage over long distances, enabling the connection of multiple bus parts.
 In certain scenarios, hubs or network devices can be utilized to join different bus parts. While this process introduces a form of central hub connectivity, it effectively integrates multiple bus topologies.
 Combining bus topologies with other topologies, such as star or tree topologies, can result in integrated network designs. For example, a star-bus topology integrates the characteristics of both bus and star topologies, where multiple bus segments are interlinked. 
Frequently Asked Question on Bus Topology – FAQs
What are the components of bus topology?
The major components of bus topology include backbone cable , terminator and droplines.
Is there a server in bus topology?
In a bus architecture, every node is directly connected to a single main cable. The network’s backbone is the primary cable. One of computer is work as a server from the network.
Is bus topology half-duplex or full- duplex?
Bus topology is half duplex.
Data transfer in bus topology is accomplished by a procedure called “collision detection.” A signal sent by one device on the network is broadcast to all other devices in the network. When two devices attempt to transmit data simultaneously, there is a collision that results in distorted signals.

The three basic states of matter are solid, liquid, and gaseous. All of the materials we come into contact with on a daily basis (from ice cream to chairs to water) are composed of matter. On the basis of intermolecular forces and particle arrangement, matter can be classified into three states: solid, liquid, and gas. These three types of matter can be converted from one state to another by modifying certain environmental factors (increasing or decreasing pressure and temperature, for instance). By increasing the temperature, for example, ice can be transformed from a solid into liquid water. 
In this article, you will study 
What is Matter?
Matter is the substance that makes up everything in the physical universe. It is anything that has mass and occupies space. Matter is composed of tiny particles called atoms, which are the basic building blocks of all chemical elements. These atoms can combine to form molecules, which in turn can combine to create more complex substances.
Matter Definition
Matter is defined as anything that occupies space and has mass. 
Atoms are the building blocks of all matter, consisting of protons, neutrons, and electrons. Chemical energy is a type of potential energy that holds together atoms and molecules. “Anything with mass and volume” is defined as matter (takes up space). It’s not difficult to show that most of the products we interact with on a daily basis have mass and take up space.
One of the distinct forms that the various phases of matter take are the condition of the matter. In everyday life, four states of matter can be found: solid, liquid, gas, and plasma. Many other states, such as Bose-Einstein condensate and neutron degenerate matter, are thought to exist only in extremely cold or dense matter. Other states, such as quark-gluon plasmas, are thought to be possible but are still considered theoretical for the time being.
The device’s states are either gaseous, liquid, or solid. Solids have a tight atomic bond and a high viscosity, which results in a rigid form. Most solids are crystalline in the sense that they have a three-dimensional periodic atomic structure; however, some solids (such as glass) lack this periodic arrangement and are therefore non-crystalline or amorphous.
The particles (ions, atoms, or molecules) in the solid are tightly packed together. The forces between the particles are so strong that the particles can only vibrate and cannot move freely. As a result, the solid has a consistent, definite shape and volume. Solids can only change shape by applying force to them as if they were broken or cut. A liquid is a nearly incompressible fluid that conforms to the shape of its container while maintaining a (nearly) constant volume regardless of pressure. If temperature and pressure remain constant, volume is defined. When a solid is heated past its melting point, it becomes liquid when the pressure exceeds the material’s triple point. The molecules in a gas have enough kinetic energy that the impact of intermolecular forces is small (or zero in the ideal gas) and the normal distance between adjacent molecules is much greater than the molecular size. The gas has no distinct shape or volume, but it completely fills the container in which it is contained.
One of the three fundamental states of matter is solid. A solid forms from a liquid or gas because the energy of atoms lowers as they take up a somewhat organised, three-dimensional structure. 
Solids have characteristics that distinguish them from liquids and gases. All solids, for example, can withstand forces applied perpendicular or parallel to a surface (i.e., normal or shear loads, respectively). Such properties are determined by the properties of the atoms that make up the solid, how those atoms are arranged, and the forces that exist between them. 
The properties of solids are:
One of the fundamental states of matter is solid state.
The rigidity of solids distinguishes them from liquids and gases.
Because of strong intermolecular forces, the molecules of solids are tightly packed and only oscillate around their mean positions.
Liquids and gases, on the other hand, have the property of fluidity and can easily flow.
Solids are states of matter that have a definite shape and volume as well as a rigid structure.
Solids have the least compressibility and thermal expansion of any material. Iron is an example
The most visible physical properties of a liquid are volume retention and conformation to the shape of its container. When a liquid substance is poured into a vessel, it takes on the shape of the vessel and will remain inside as long as the substance is liquid. Furthermore, when a liquid is poured from one vessel to another, it retains its volume but not its shape (as long as there is no vaporization or temperature change). 
These properties are useful for distinguishing between the liquid and solid states. Gases, for example, expand to fill their container to the point where their volume equals that of the container. When moving solids from one container to another, they keep their shape and volume. 
Its properties are:
Because of weak intermolecular forces, the molecules in a liquid are tightly packed.
These forces are weaker in solids but stronger in gases.
Liquid molecules have a lot of space between them, which allows them to flow easily.
Liquids have a fixed volume and can easily take on the shape of a vessel.
The conversion of solids to liquids occurs when the temperature of the solids is raised to the point where the solids begin to melt.
In general, the density of liquids falls somewhere between the densities of solids and gases. Liquids have slightly higher compressibility and thermal expansion than solids.
Water is an example
Gases are remarkable in that they appear to have no structure at all. They have neither a definite size nor a definite shape, whereas ordinary solids have both a definite size and a definite shape, and liquids have a definite size, or volume, even though their shape adapts to that of the container in which they are placed. 
Gases will completely fill any closed container; their properties are determined by the volume of the container rather than its shape. Its properties are:
The distances between molecules are large in this state of matter.
The intermolecular forces that exist between them are insignificant.
As a result, translatory, rotatory, and vibratory motions are prominent in gases.
Gases have no fixed shape or volume.
They are also very compressible and have a high thermal expansion.
Oxygen is an example.
Plasma is a type of matter that is not commonly seen. Plasma is made up of particles with a very high kinetic energy. Electricity is used to ionise noble gases, resulting in glowing signs that are essentially plasma. Stars are superheated forms of plasma.
Bose-Einstein condensates were discovered in 1995 as a result of technological advancements. Carl Wieman and Eric Cornell used magnets and lasers to cool a rubidium sample to a few degrees below absolute zero. The motion of the molecules becomes negligible at the specified temperature. As the kinetic energy decreases, the atoms no longer remain separate and begin to clump together. When the atoms combine, they form a super-atom. As light passes through a BEC, it slows down, allowing scientists to learn more about the nature of light as a wave and particle. BECs also exhibit superfluid properties, implying that they flow without friction.
Sample Questions on What is Matter 
Pressure has the ability to change the state of matter. Certain matters frequently vary, but often only occur in two states and necessitate human and technical assistance to progress through all three stages. Water is the only substance on the planet that can exist naturally in all three states: solid, liquid, and oil.
Light is a type of energy, not matter. Atoms make up matter. Light, in fact, is electromagnetic radiation. A magnetic field is created when an electrical charge or electrons (electrical current) move, and a changing magnetic field creates an electrical or electrical field.
Physical and chemical properties can be used to classify matter. Matter is defined as something that occupies space and has mass. Solid, liquid, and gaseous are the three states of matter. The conversion of a material from one state of matter to another without changing its chemical composition is referred to as a physical transition.
Small particles make up matter as well. Atoms are the subatomic particles that make up matter. Atoms are invisible because they are so small. The majority of atoms combine to form the visible substance.
Understanding the particle nature of matter is critical. Matter is made up of atoms and molecules, not “small solid bits” or small liquid drops. The physical properties of such atoms and molecules determine their state.

Python Programs – FAQs
What are programs in Python?
Python programs are sets of instructions written in the Python programming language. These instructions, or code, are executed by the Python interpreter to perform specific tasks, ranging from simple functions like adding numbers to complex operations like web development or data analysis. A Python program typically includes elements like variables, functions, and control structures that work together to manipulate data and produce desired outcomes.
Common codes in Python include solutions for tasks such as:
String manipulation (e.g., reversing strings)
Mathematical problems (e.g., factorial, Fibonacci)
Data structure operations (e.g., lists, sets, dictionaries)
File handling (e.g., reading and writing files) These codes are widely used and often serve as building blocks for larger programs.
How to write Python programs?
To write Python programs, follow these steps:
1. 
 Understand and outline what you want your program to achieve.
2. 
 Install Python and set up a code editor or IDE to write your code.
3. 
 Start by importing necessary libraries, if needed. Use variables, functions, and control structures to build your program.
4. 
 Run your program to see if it works as expected. Fix any issues by debugging your code.
5. 
 Optimize and refactor your code for better efficiency and readability.
6. 
 Add comments and documentation to explain what your code does.
By practicing these steps, you can progressively handle more complex projects and enhance your programming skills.
Programming Python code involves writing scripts or applications using the Python language. Python’s simple syntax makes it ideal for beginners, and its vast ecosystem supports complex tasks such as data analysis, machine learning, web development, and automation. Examples of Python code cover a range of topics like algorithms, file handling, and web scraping.
Python 3 programs refer to scripts and applications written specifically for Python version 3, the latest major release of Python. Python 3 introduced several new features and syntax changes, making it more efficient and modern compared to Python 2. Most new programming examples, including those found online, follow Python 3 standards.
A Py program is a general term used to refer to any program or script written in the Python language. “Py” is a shorthand commonly used to reference Python, and you may see it in file names (e.g., 
.py
 extension), packages, and documentation. A Py program can range from a simple “Hello World” script to complex machine learning applications.

Fiber Optics or Optical Fiber is a technology that transmits data as a light pulse along a glass or plastic fiber. An Optical Fiber is a cylindrical fiber of glass that is hair-thin in size or any transparent dielectric medium. The fiber which is used for optical communication is waveguides made of transparent dielectrics. In this article, we will discuss Optical Fiber/Fiber Optics in detail. 
What is Fiber Optics?
Fiber optics refers to the technology and method of 
 as light pulses along a glass or plastic strand or fiber. 
 are used for long-distance and high-performance 
. They are capable of transmitting data over longer distances and at higher bandwidths (data rates) than electrical cables, making them a critical component in 
,
 
, and 
.
It is the central tube of very thin size made of optically transparent dielectric medium and carries the light transmitter to receiver and the core diameter may vary from about 5um to 100 um. 
 It is an outer optical material surrounding the core having a reflecting index lower than the core and cladding helps to keep the light within the core throughout the phenomena of total internal reflection. 
  It is a plastic coating that protects the fiber made of silicon rubber. The typical diameter of the fiber after the coating is  250-300 um.  
Types of Fiber Optics
There are different types of fiber optics based on several categories as mentioned below:
 In 
single-mode fibe
r, only one type of ray of light can propagate through the fiber. This type of fiber has a small core diameter (5um) and high cladding diameter (70um) and the difference between the 
refractive index
 of core and cladding is very small. There is no dispersion i.e. no degradation of the 
signal
 during traveling through the fiber. The light is passed through it through a laser diode. 
 
Multimode fiber
 allows many modes for the light rays traveling through it. The core diameter is generally (40um) and that of cladding is (70um). The relative refractive index difference is also greater than single-mode fiber. There is signal degradation due to multimode dispersion. It is not suitable for long-distance communication due to the large dispersion and attenuation of the signal. There are two categories based on Multi-mode fiber i.e. 
 and 
. These are categories under the types of optical fiber based on the Refractive Index 
 The refractive index of the core is constant. The refractive index of the cladding is also continuous. The 
rays of light
 propagate through it in the form of meridional rays which cross the fiber axis during every reflection at the core-cladding boundary. 
 In this type of fiber, the core has a non-uniform refractive index that gradually decreases from the center towards the core-cladding interface. The cladding has a uniform refractive index. The light rays propagate through it in the form of skew rays or helical rays. it does not cross the fiber axis at any time. 
: For transmission of light, polymethylmethacrylate is used as core material
 These are extremely fine glass fibers, the core and cladding of the optical fiber is made of plastic.
How Fiber Optic Works?
Fiber Optics has the work of transmission of light particles, or photons. Fiber optics transmit data as light through thin sheets of glass or plastic. Each fiber consists of a core, where the light travels through it, and a surrounding cladding that reflects the light back into the core part. Data is converted into light using a laser or 
LED,
 and these light pulses travel through the core, bouncing off the cladding to stay contained in it.  At the receiving end, a photodetector converts the light back into the electrical signals. This technology allows for fast, high-capacity data transmission with minimal signal loss, immunity to electromagnetic interference, and therefore the security is enhanced. Fiber optics are generally used for high-speed internet, telecommunications, medical devices, and many more industrial applications.
Uses of Fiber Optics
Fiber Optics can be used in Computer Broadcasting and Networking
Fiber Optics are used on the 
Internet
. They are also used in Television Cable.
Fiber Optics are widely used in Military Activities. They are also used in Medical Purposes like for precise illumination.
They can also be used in Underwater environments as they don’t require to be replaced frequently.
Advantages of Fiber Optics
Fiber Optics supports bandwidth with higher capacities.
Electromagnetic Interference is very little with Fiber Optics.
Fiber Optics are stronger and lighter than copper cables.
Very little Maintenance is required in Optical Fiber.
Disadvantages of Fiber Optics
Fiber Optics is more costly than Copper Wire.
Huge manual work is required to install new cables.
Some optical fibers like glass fiber require more protection.
Fiber Optics are more fragile i.e., can be easily broken, or signals can be lost easily.
Previously Asked Questions
 
(a) Fiber optic cable is much lighter than 
copper cable
(b) Fiber optic cable is not affected by power surges or electromagnetic interference
(c) Optical transmission is inherently bidirectional.

Kinematics is the study of motion of points, objects, and systems by examining their motion from a geometric perspective, without focusing on the forces that cause such movements or the physical characteristics of the objects involved. This study area uses algebra to create mathematical models that describe these motions, essentially treating it as the mathematics behind how things move. 
Kinematics is a field of classical mechanics that deals with the motion of points, objects, and systems of objects. Kinematics is sometimes referred to as “motion geometry” by some professionals. Let’s have a look at the formula for kinematics.
In this article, we shall learn about kinematics, which is the study of motion, along with its formulas, derivation of kinematics formula, examples and others in detail.
What is Kinematics?
Kinematics is concerned with the trajectories of points, lines, and other geometric objects to describe motion. Furthermore, it concentrates on deferential qualities such as velocity and acceleration. Astrophysics, mechanical engineering, robotics, and biomechanics all use kinematics extensively.
Kinematic formulas are a collection of equations that connect the five kinematic variables: Displacement (Δx), time interval (t), Initial Velocity (v
0
), Final Velocity (v), Constant Acceleration (a).
Kinematic formulas are only accurate if the acceleration remains constant across the time frame in question; we must be careful not to apply them when the acceleration changes. The kinematic formulas also imply that all variables correspond to the same direction: horizontal 
, vertical 
, and so on.
Kinematics Definition
Kinematics is the study of motion in its simplest form. Kinematics is a branch of mathematics that deals with the motion of any object. The study of moving objects and their interactions is known as kinematics. Kinematics is also a branch of classical mechanics that describes and explains the motion of points, objects, and systems of bodies.
Kinematic Formulas
The kinematics formulas deal with displacement, velocity, time, and acceleration. In addition, the following are the four kinematic formulas:
Note that, One of the five kinematic variables in each kinematic formula is missing.
Derivation of Kinematic Formulas
Here is the derivation of the four-kinematics formula mentioned above:
We have,
Acceleration = Velocity / Time
We can now use the definition of velocity change v-v
0 
to replace Δv.
This becomes the first kinematic formula if we agree to just use t for Δt.
Displacement Δx can be found under any velocity graph. The object’s displacement Δx will be represented by the region beneath this velocity graph.
Δx is a total area, This region can be divided into a blue rectangle and a red triangle for ease of use.
The blue rectangle’s area is v
0
t since its height is v
0
 and its width is t. And The red triangle area is 
 since its base is t and its height is v-v
0
.
The sum of the areas of the blue rectangle and the red triangle will be the entire area,
Finally, to obtain the second kinematic formula,
From Second Kinematic Formula,
put v = v
0
 + at we get,
Δx/t = (v
0
+at+v
0
)/2
Δx/t = v
0 
+ at/2
Finally, to obtain the third kinematic formula,
From Second Kinematic Formula,
v=v
0
+at  …(From First Kinematic Formula)
t = (v-v
0
)/a
Put the value of t in Second Kinematic Formula,
Δx = ((v+v
0
)/2) × ((v-v
0
)/a)
Δx = (v
2
+v
0
2
)/2a
We get Fourth Kinematic Formula by solving v

,
Key Concept in Kinematics
Kinematics is a branch of mechanics that describes the motion of objects without considering the causes of this motion (i.e., forces). It involves the study of displacement, velocity, and acceleration of moving objects.
Displacement is a vector quantity that refers to the change in position of an object. It has both magnitude and direction.
where,
x
f
 is the Final Position
x
i
 is the Initial Position
Velocity is a vector quantity that denotes the rate of change of displacement with respect to time. It includes both speed and direction.
where,
 is Displacement
 is the Time Interval
 Acceleration is a vector quantity that represents the rate of change of velocity with respect to time.
where,
 is Change in Velocity
 is the Time Interval
Relative motion describes the motion of an object as observed from a particular frame of reference.
Position and Displacement
 is a vector quantity that represents the location of an object in a given frame of reference. It is often described using coordinates in one, two, or three-dimensional space.
 is a vector quantity that represents the change in position of an object. It is defined as the straight-line distance and direction from the initial position to the final position.
Differences Between Position and Displacement
Various differences between Position and Dispalcement are added in the table below:
Location of an object in space
Change in position of an object
Vector
Vector
Described by coordinates in 1D, 2D, or 3D space
Difference between initial and final position
Absolute value of coordinates
Straight-line distance between two positions
Not inherently directional (depends on reference)
Always directional (from initial to final)
Speed and Velocity
is a scalar quantity that measures the rate at which an object covers distance. It only has magnitude and no direction. Speed is always positive or zero.
is a vector quantity that measures the rate of change of displacement with respect to time. It has both magnitude and direction. Velocity can be positive, negative, or zero.
Differences Between Speed and Velocity
Various differences between Speed and Velocity are added in the table below:

Vector
Components
Magnitude only
Magnitude and direction
Formula
v = d/t
v = Δx/t
Positive/Negative
Always positive or zero
Can be positive, negative, or zero
Direction

60 km/hr north
Acceleration
Acceleration is the rate at which an object’s velocity changes with time. It indicates whether an object is speeding up, slowing down, or changing direction.
Average acceleration (a) is calculated by dividing the change in velocity (Δv) by the time interval (Δt) over which the change occurs:
where Δv =v
f
 – v
i
 (final velocity minus initial velocity).
SI unit of acceleration is meters per second squared (m/s²).

Kinematics Question and Answer 
:
Distance, displacement, speed, velocity, acceleration, and jerk all affect the many variables in kinematics. Kinematics is not concerned with an object’s mass; rather, it is concerned with its motion. It’s completely descriptive and based on their observations, such as tossing a ball or operating a train.
:
Examples of Kinematics:
A river’s flow.
a stone flung from a great height.
On a merry-go-round, children sit.
swings of the pendulum.
Kinematics Solved Examples
:
Given: t = 7s, v
0 
= 0 m/s, a = 16 m/s
2
Since,
s = 0 × 7 + (1/2) × 16 × 7
2
= (1/2) × 16 × 49
= 8 × 49
:
Given: v
0
 = 2 m/s, a = 20 m/s
2
, t = 6s
Since,
v = 2 + 20 × 6
:
Given: v
0
 = 0 m/s, v = 5 m/s, t = 4s
Since,
Δx = (5+0) × 4
Given: v
0
 = 0 m/s, a = 6 m/s
2
, t = 3s
Since,
= 0 + 6 × 3

Solved Examples on Math Formulas
Given:
Total number of favorable outcomes n(S) = 52
Number of face cards  in the deck = 12
Number of favorable outcomes n(A) = 12
Now,
P(A) = n(A)/n(S)
= 12/52
= 3/13
Hence, the probability to get a face card from a card deck is 3/13.
3/(x-1) + 1/(x – 1) = 2/x
4/(x – 1) = 2/x
2x = x – 1
x = -1
Given,

Given:
Radius of Circle = 21cm
We have,
Area of the circle (A) = πr
2
A = 22/7 × 21 × 21
A = 1386cm
2
Hence, the area of the given circle is 1386cm
2
Given:
Base of the triangle =100cm
Height of the triangle = 20cm
We have,
Area(A) = 1/2 × b × h
              = 1/2 × 10 × 20
              = 1000cm
2
Given,
Total Fraction of Land = 4/5
Total Fraction used for Farming = 2/5.
Now,
Land  Left = 4/5 – 2/5
                 = 2/5
Hence, 2/5 part of the field is left for other purposes.
Given,
= 20% of 240kg
= 20/100 × 240
= 48 kg
Hence, 20% of 240 kg will be 48 kg.

is an important term used in the Ray Optics branch of Physics. 
 is defined as the change in direction or the bending of a wave passing from one medium to another due to the change in speed of the wave. Some natural phenomena occurring in nature where refraction of light takes place are the twinkling of stars, the formation of mirages and Rainbows, Optical illusions, and many more. The major cause of refraction to occur is the change in the speed of waves in different mediums, which is different due to the difference between the densities of the mediums. e.g. the speed of light in a vacuum is maximum.
 provides a quantitative description of the amount of bending of a wave, that depends on the 
 of the two mediums. Let’s learn more about refraction like the Laws of Refractions, Causes of Refraction, Types of Refraction, Examples, and Applications of Refractions in the article below.
What is Refraction of Light?
The bending of a light wave when it passes from one medium to another due to the change in the speed of the light traveling the two different media is called the Refraction of light.
This phenomenon also occurs with sound, water, and other waves. Because of this bending of waves that are responsible for the refraction of light, we have lenses, magnifying glasses, prisms, and rainbows. Due to this phenomenon, our eyes would not be able to focus, without the refraction of light.
As shown in the above figure, light travels from Medium 1 to Medium 2. Please note that these mediums can be different materials or substances with different densities. So when an incident ray from medium 1 travels to another medium 2, the refracted ray bends either towards the normal or away from the normal (depending upon the densities of the mediums). 
Here are the definitions of important terms used to study Refraction:
 The point of the surface at which an optical phenomenon occurs is called the normal. In simple words, it is termed the 
. It is shown by a dotted line drawn perpendicular to the surface of the refracting material, in a ray diagram.
 The light rays that strike the refracting surface, at the separation of two media are called the Incident Ray.
 The light rays that bend after passing into another medium are called the Refracted Ray.
This is the angle between the incident ray and the normal. It is represented by ∠i and it is also called an 
.
 This is the angle between refracted ray and the normal. It is represented by ∠r and it is also called a 
.
Laws of Refraction of Light
The refraction of light traveling through different mediums follows some laws. There are two 
laws of refraction
 as stated below which at the sight of refraction, the light follows, and we see the refracted image of the object.
The reflected, incident, and the normal at the point of incidence all will tend to lie in the same plane.
Secondly, the ratio of the sine of the angle of the incidence and refraction is constant which is termed 
.
where i is the angle of incidence, r is the angle of refraction, the constant value depends on the refractive indexes of the two mediums. 
What is the Refractive Index?
The
 Refractive index
 also called the index of refraction enables us to know how fast light travels through the material medium.
Refractive Index is a dimensionless quantity. For a given material or medium, the refractive index is considered the ratio between the speed of light in a vacuum (c) to the speed of light in the medium (v) on which it goes. The Refractive index for a medium is represented by small n, and it is given by the following formula:
where 
c is the speed of the light in a vacuum, and 
v is the speed of light in the medium.
The given velocities of light in different media can give the refractive index by the following also where the first medium is not vacuum:
where n
21 
is the refractive index of 2 with respect to 1.
Based on the given refractive index of the material or medium, the light ray either changes its direction or bends at the junction which separates the two given media. If the light ray travels from a certain medium to another of a slightly higher refractive index, it bends towards the normal in that case when traveling from rarer to a denser medium, or else it bends away from the normal when traveling from denser to rarer medium.
Snell’s Law
Snell’s law
 provides the degree or extent of refraction that occurs through a relationship between the incident angle, refracted angles, and the refractive indices of a given pair of media.
According to Snell’s law, the ratio of the sine of the incident angle to the sine of the refracted angle is a constant, for any light of a given color or for any given pair of media. The constant value is called the refractive index of the second medium with respect to the first.
Snell’s Law is given by the relation,
or 
where, 
i and r are the angle of incidence and refraction,
n is the refractive index and n
1
 and n
2
 are the refractive indices of medium 1 and 2, and
v
1
 and v
2
 are the speed of light in medium 1 and 2 respectively.
Causes of Refraction of Light 
As it is known that when light travels in different mediums its speed varies. e.g. light passes through the air than in a glass. Hence, it can be said that, due to the change in the speed of light in different mediums that the light rays are refracted.
To understand the causes of refraction of light in much depth let’s understand What are rarer and denser mediums? and Types of Refractions as:
What are Rarer and Denser mediums?
 (or Optically Rarer medium) is a medium in which the speed of light is more. For example, Air is optically rarer medium as compared to glass and water.
(or Optically Denser medium) is a medium in which the speed of light is less. For example, Glass is optically denser medium as compared to air.
Types of Refraction
The refraction of light occurs in different ways depending on the medium through which the light travels. 
When light rays pass through rarer to a denser medium, the light rays bend towards the normal. Due to this the angle of refraction is smaller than the angle of incidence. e.g. In the case when light rays pass from air to water or from air to glass, it bends towards normal. It is because of the reason that the speed of light rays reduces while passing from air to glass or water.
When light rays pass from denser to rarer medium, the light rays bend away from the normal. Due to this the angle of refraction becomes more than the angle of incidence. e.g. In case when light rays pass from water to air or glass to air, light rays bend away from the normal. The speed of light rays becomes greater while passing from glass or water to air. 
Characteristics of Refraction
Some of the important characteristics of Refraction are:
The frequency of light does not change when it travels from one medium to another, but the velocity and wavelength of light changes.
A ray of light bends when it travels from one optical medium to another with a variable refractive index. For a specific pair of media, the ratio of the sine of the angle of incidence to the sine of the angle of refraction is constant.
The relationship between a medium’s refractive index and the speed of light in that medium is as follows:
where, 
i and r are the angle of incidence and refraction,
n is the refractive index and n
1
 and n
2
 are the refractive indices of medium 1 and 2, and
v
1
 and v
2
 are the speed of light in medium 1 and 2 respectively.
Effects of Refraction of Light 
When anything interrupts the light waves, it causes refraction of the light. Light also moves mostly in the form of waves, much like most other materials. 
As shown below, the pencil seems deformed in the water because light cannot travel through the water as rapidly as it can through the air. The pencil has a tiny magnification effect due to the light refraction, which makes the angle appear larger than it actually is and makes the pencil appear crooked.
Examples of Refraction of Light
The stars twinkle in the night sky due to the refraction of their light.
Looming and Mirage formation, both occur due to the optical illusions caused by the refraction of light. 
The formation of rainbows in the sky and VIBGYOR, when white light passes through the prism are also major examples of refraction.
A swimming pool always seems or looks much shallower than it really is because of the light that comes from the bottom of the pool bends at the surfaces due to the refraction of light.
Applications of Refraction of Light
Refraction has many wide and common applications in optics and also in technology. A few of them are given below:
A lens uses the refraction phenomenon to form an image of an object or body for various purposes, such as magnification.
Spectacles that are worn by people with defective vision use the principle of refraction.
Refraction is used in peepholes of the house doors for safety, in cameras, inside movie projectors, and also in telescopes.
Solved Examples on Refraction of Light
As we know,
sin i / sin r = constant
Given sin i = sin 22° and sin r = sin 22°
Putting the values of angles from log table we get
sin 22° / sin 15° = 1.44
Hence, the value of constant or refractive index is 
.
Since, the 
sin i / sin r = constant
Given sin i= sin 30
 and sin r= sin 46
Putting the values of angles from log table we get
sin 30° / sin 46° = 1.44
Hence, the constant is 
.
As we know,
{sin i}/{sin r} =constant
Given constant= 1.33 and sin r = sin 35
 = 0.57
Putting the values of angles from log table we get
sin i / sin 35° = 1.33
sin i = 1.33 × 0.57
=
As we know we can calculate refractive index by the following formula,
n = c/v
where refractive index of diamond n= 2.42, c = 3 × 10
8
 m/s
Hence, the velocity or speed of light in glass is v
d

FAQs based on Refraction of light
The change that occurs in the direction of a wave when light passes from one medium to the other is known as refraction of light.
When the light is incident perpendicular to the boundary or surface, refraction of light is not possible.
The bouncing back of light when it strikes a smooth surface is called Reflection. While the bending of a light ray when it travels from one medium to other is called refraction of light.
There are many examples of refraction of light observed in our daily life like the Twinkling of stars. The Twinkling of stars is because of the atmospheric refraction occurs by the light from the star undergoing a gradual change in the medium.

Software Development Processes Steps
Software development is a complex and multifaceted process that transforms a concept or idea into a functional, reliable software application. To ensure the successful creation of software, developers follow a structured process that consists of several key steps. Each step in the software development process contributes to the overall success of the project. It’s a collaborative effort that involves different roles, and the effectiveness of each step impacts the final quality, functionality, and user satisfaction of the software. By understanding these steps, their uses, significance, advantages, and disadvantages, you can appreciate the intricacies and challenges of software development.
5 Steps of Software Development Process
Stage 1: Planning and Requirement Gathering
The first step in software development is gathering and understanding the requirements. This stage involves identifying the needs, objectives, and constraints of the project. The goal is to define what the software should do and what problems it will solve.

System Design
 is the process of designing the architecture, components, and interfaces for a system so that it meets the end-user requirements. This specifically designed System Design tutorial will help you to learn and master System Design concepts in the most efficient way from basics to advanced level.
 Steps for approaching this system design tutorial 
 Before starting the design process, it is important to understand the requirements and constraints of the system. This includes gathering information about the problem space, performance requirements, scalability needs, and security concerns. 
 Identify the major components of the system and how they interact with each other. This includes determining the relationships between different components and how they contribute to the overall functionality of the system. 
 Based on the requirements and components, choose the appropriate technology to implement the system. This may involve choosing hardware and software platforms, databases, programming languages, and tools. 
 Define the interface between different components of the system, including APIs, protocols, and data formats. 
 Design the data model for the system, including the schema for the database, the structure of data files, and the data flow between components. 
 Consider scalability and performance implications of the design, including factors such as load balancing, caching, and database optimization. 
 Validate the design by testing the system with realistic data and use cases, and make changes as needed to address any issues that arise. 
 Finally, deploy the system and maintain it over time, including fixing bugs, updating components, and adding new features as needed. 
 It’s important to keep in mind that system design is an iterative process, and the design may change as new information is gathered and requirements evolve. Additionally, it’s important to communicate the design effectively to all stakeholders, including developers, users, and stakeholders, to ensure that the system meets their needs and expectations.

 Advantages of System Design 
 System design helps to clarify the requirements and constraints of a system, which can lead to a better understanding of the problem space. 
 By designing a system with appropriate technology and optimized data structures, system design can improve the efficiency and performance of a system. 
 System design can help ensure that a system is scalable and can accommodate future growth and changing requirements. 
 By defining clear interfaces and data models, system design can improve the maintainability of a system and make it easier to update and modify over time. 
 System design helps to communicate the design of a system to stakeholders, including developers and users, which can help ensure that the system meets their needs and expectations. 
 Disadvantages of System Design 
 The process of system design can be time-consuming, especially for large and complex systems. 
 System design can be expensive, especially if it involves significant research, prototyping, and testing. 
 System design requires a significant amount of technical expertise, including knowledge of hardware, software, databases, and data structures. 
 Once a system design is complete, it can be difficult to make changes to the design, especially if the design has already been implemented and deployed.

A 
 is also known as 
 is created to display the summary of the set of data values having properties like minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile and maximum. In the box plot, a box is created from the first quartile to the third quartile, a vertical line is also there which goes through the box at the median. Here x-axis denotes the data to be plotted while the y-axis shows the frequency distribution.
Creating Box Plot
The 
matplotlib.pyplot
 module of matplotlib library provides boxplot() function with the help of which we can create box plots.
 
matplotlib.pyplot.boxplot(data, notch=None, vert=None, patch_artist=None, widths=None)
 
Attribute
Value
data
array or sequence of array to be plotted
notch
optional parameter accepts boolean values
vert
optional parameter accepts boolean values false and true for horizontal and vertical plot respectively
bootstrap
optional parameter accepts int specifies intervals around notched boxplots
usermedians
optional parameter accepts array or sequence of array dimension compatible with data
positions
optional parameter accepts array and sets the position of boxes
widths
optional parameter accepts array and sets the width of boxes
patch_artist
optional parameter having boolean values
labels
sequence of strings sets label for each dataset
meanline
optional having boolean value try to render meanline as full width of box
order
optional parameter sets the order of the boxplot
The data values given to the ax.boxplot() method can be a Numpy array or Python list or Tuple of arrays. Let us create the box plot by using numpy.random.normal() to create some random data, it takes mean, standard deviation, and the desired number of values as arguments.

Customizing Box Plot
The matplotlib.pyplot.boxplot() provides endless customization possibilities to the box plot. The notch = True attribute creates the notch format to the box plot, patch_artist = True fills the boxplot with colors, we can set different colors to different boxes.The vert = 0 attribute creates horizontal box plot. labels takes same dimensions as the number data sets.

Box Plot in Python using Matplotlib – FAQs
How To Convert Python Dictionary To JSON?
To convert a Python dictionary to JSON, you use the 
json
 module, which provides functions for serializing Python objects to JSON format.
import json
dictionary = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}
json_string = json.dumps(dictionary)
print(json_string)
{"name": "Alice", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}
What modules are used to serialize Python dictionaries to JSON?
The primary module used for serializing Python dictionaries to JSON is the built-in 
json
 module.
Functions provided by the 
json
 module for serialization include:
json.dumps()
: Serializes a Python object to a JSON-formatted string.
json.dump()
: Serializes a Python object to a JSON-formatted stream (e.g., a file).
How to handle complex objects while converting to JSON in Python?
When dealing with complex objects that are not natively serializable by JSON (e.g., custom objects, sets), you can use the 
default
 parameter of 
json.dumps()
 to specify a function that converts these objects to serializable types.
import json
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
def person_serializer(obj):
    if isinstance(obj, Person):
        return {'name': obj.name, 'age': obj.age}
    raise TypeError(f"Type {type(obj)} not serializable")
person = Person('Alice', 30)
json_string = json.dumps(person, default=person_serializer)
print(json_string)
{"name": "Alice", "age": 30}
How to convert a list of dictionaries to JSON in Python?
You can convert a list of dictionaries to JSON using the 
json.dumps()
 function, just as you would with a single dictionary.
import json
list_of_dicts = [
    {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30},
    {'name': 'Bob', 'age': 25}
]
json_string = json.dumps(list_of_dicts)
print(json_string)
[{"name": "Alice", "age": 30}, {"name": "Bob", "age": 25}]
What are the options for pretty-printing JSON in Python?
To pretty-print JSON, you can use the 
indent
 parameter of 
json.dumps()
 or 
json.dump()
 to add indentation and make the JSON output more readable.
import json
dictionary = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}
json_string = json.dumps(dictionary, indent=4)
print(json_string)
{
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 30,
    "city": "New York"
}
You can also use the 
json.dump()
 function to write pretty-printed JSON directly to a file:
import json
dictionary = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}
with open('data.json', 'w') as file:
    json.dump(dictionary, file, indent=4)
In this case, the file 
data.json
 will contain pretty-printed JSON data.

Chemistry is the scientific study of matter, its properties, composition, and interactions. It is often referred to as the central science because it connects and bridges the physical sciences, such as physics and biology. Understanding chemistry is crucial for comprehending the world around us, from the air we breathe to the food we eat and the materials we use in everyday life.
Chemistry has many sub-disciplines such as analytical chemistry, physical chemistry, biochemistry, and more. Chemistry plays a crucial role in various industries, including pharmaceuticals, materials science, environmental science, and energy production, making it a cornerstone of modern science and technology
The area of science devoted to studying nature and also composition, properties, elements, and compounds that form matter as well as looking into their reactions forming new substances is chemistry. Chemistry has also been categorized further based on the particular areas of study.
What is Chemistry?
Chemistry focuses on the properties, both physical and chemical structure, transformations they undergo as well as the energy that is either absorbed or released during reactions that accompany these structural changes.
All materials on earth whether they are naturally occurring or are artificially produced include fundamental units known as atoms. These atoms also consist of elementary particles, but they are called the structural and fundamental entities of chemical substances.
Chemistry includes writing the composition of compounds, their uses, and also how they are used along with the synthesis of new compounds by combining two or more substances.
Chemical processes include cooking, fermentation, glass making, and also metallurgy. Advancements in chemical technology have led to the production of semiconductors, liquid crystals, Teflon, and also superconductors among others.
Branches of Chemistry
Chemistry is divided into five branches as follows:
Physical Chemistry 
Organic Chemistry
Inorganic Chemistry 
Analytical Chemistry 
Biochemistry
Physical Chemistry
Here, this field of chemistry focuses on the many processes and changes that take place in materials. It tries to quantify, correlate, and rationalize the structural properties of reactions through its unique approach focusing on physical principles underlying all chemical interactions (e.g., gas laws). It is a combination of physics and also chemistry to examine the elements in a superior manner.
In physical chemistry, we can see how molecules and atoms interact with each other to create specific molecules. We can also know many other aspects of the issue, such as those relating to its transformation from solidity into liquid.
Organic Chemistry
Organic chemistry is one of the branches of this science that describes the structure, properties, and reactions of carbohydrates having carbon atoms as a dominant element. Chemicals in this branch are hydrocarbons (compounds containing only carbon and hydrogen) as well as other substances that contain carbon along with oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, phosphorus halogens etc.
These substances and chemicals make up the organic compounds that dominate over earthly life forms.
Inorganic Chemistry
This category contains the analysis of non-carbon compounds and also some organometallic combinations. It primarily discusses the non-carbon compounds. Most inorganic compounds are ionic, comprising the cations and anions linked by ion-covalent bonds. The study of oxides, carbonates, sulfates and also halides are included in the Inorganic compounds.
Analytical Chemistry
This branch deals with the separation and quantification techniques using various equipment. It involves a number of techniques to study and measure substances like separation, the identification or quantification This branch may employ classical methods, wet chemical methods and also modern analytical techniques. 
Biochemistry
This is the branch of chemistry that specializes in examining the chemical substances and reactions involved with plants, animals, or also microorganisms. This branch deals with the chemistry of the life.
Examples and Applications of Chemistry in Our Daily Lives
Chemical reactions are always taking place around us. The human body is made up of chemical substances. Our human body is 70% water. The way we react to situations is all because of the chemical reactions of hormones. From the digestion of food to how we think, we are surrounded by chemistry and chemical reactions. A few applications of chemistry in our daily lives are given below :
A chemical reaction is the process of photosynthesis where plants make food and water, sunlight, and carbon dioxide supplies are changed into glucose and also oxygen.
Therefore, the use of soaps and detergents to get rid of dirtiness is not only a biological function but also a chemical reaction. These will not occur without the chemistry required.
Medicines are drugs that mend humans by curing them from diseases and infections.
Another use of chemicals in our daily lives is packaged foods.

In a computer network, there are multiple devices known as nodes connected together. There are multiple ways through which we can transmit data between these connected nodes. Transmission can be one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many. This transmission of data in the network is known as casting. Casting is of three types.
Types of Broadcasting
Unicast
Broadcast
Multicast
Let’s study these types of transmission networks in detail. 
Unicast 
Unicast transmission is defined as a type of transmission of data in which data is transferred from one node( single sender node) to another node( single receiver node). Unicast transmission is a type of one-to-one communication. The sender node is from one network whereas the receiver node belongs to another. Let’s understand the concept of unicast with the help of an example. 
As shown in the above diagram, we have two networks. Network A and Network B. Network A has a source host A and network B has destination host B. The data is transmitted from host A to host B. 
 10.1.2.3
20.12.2.4
Broadcast
Broadcast is defined as a type of transmission where data is transmitted from one source node to all other destination nodes. Broadcast transmission is a type of one to all communication approach. Broadcast transmission is used where all other present nodes need to see the data transmitted from the source. It is used in protocols such as 
Routing Information Protocol
(RIP) and 
Address Resolution Protocol(ARP).
 There are two types of broadcast transmission networks. 
Types of Broadcast Network
There are two types of Broadcast Network
Direct Broadcast
Limited Broadcast
A. Direct Broadcast
Direct Broadcasting is a type of transmission where one node from a network sends the data packet to all available nodes in another network. This type of broadcast is used when all the receiving hosts from another network require the same data. Direct Broadcast can be achieved by setting all the host ID part bits of receiving node’s address to Direct Broadcast is used by television networks for the transmission of audio and videos. Let’s see the example of direct broadcast. 
As shown in the above example, we have two networks, Network A and Network B.  Host A from Network A wants to transmit data to all the nodes in Network B. 
11.2.3.1 
 20.255.255.255
B. Limited Broadcast 
Limited Broadcast is defined as a type of transmission of data where the source host sends the data packets to all the other available nodes connected in the same network. The limited broadcast can be achieved by setting 1 for all the 32 bits of receiving 
IP address
. Let’s see with an example. 
As shown in the above figure, We have a single network of devices. All the devices are connected to the same network. The sending host sends the data packets to all the other nodes in the same network. 
Source IP address: 11.2.3.1
Destination IP address: 255.255.255.255
Multicast  
Multicast is defined as a type of transmission of data where one or more sending hosts sends the data packets to one or more receiving hosts in another network. This type of transmission is known as one-to-many communication. Class D of IP address is reserved for multicast groups. Multicast is more efficient than unicast when multiple nodes want to receive the same data. Let’s see the example of multicast transmission. 
As shown in the above figure, we have two networks A and B. Sending host A belongs to one network and multiple receiving hosts from network B. Examples where multicast transmission is used are:  
Video conference 
Internal Streaming 
Sending an email or WhatsApp message to a group of people 
Difference Between Direct Broadcast and Limited Broadcast 
Direct Broadcast and Limited Broadcast are the two sub-types of broadcast. Both work according to one communication approach but differs with respect to some properties. Let’s see the difference between them. 
Parameter 
Direct Broadcast 
Limited Broadcast 
Direct Broadcasting is a type of transmission where one node from a network sends the data packet to all available nodes in another network. 
Limited Broadcast is defined as a type of transmission of data where the source host sends the data packets to all the other available nodes connected in the same network. 
Direct Broadcast consists of two networks. Sending hosts from one network and receiving hosts from another network. 
Limited Broadcast consists of only one network. ie. Both sending hosts and receiving hosts are from the same network. 
Source IP address: 11.2.3.1  
Destination IP address: 20.255.255.255
Source IP address: 11.2.3.1 
Destination IP address: 255.255.255.255
Direct Broadcast is used in Television networks for the transmission of audio and videos.
A Limited Broadcast network is used in cal Area Network(LAN).
  Check for the difference between  
Unicast, Broadcast and Multicast
.
FAQs on Broadcast Network
1. Incoming broadcast traffic can be restricted by which device? 
Incoming broadcast traffic can be restricted by Routers. If the router receives any input broadcast signal router can drop it. 
2. What are the applications of broadcast networking?
Broadcast networking is used in applications such as televisions, Video games, email, WhatsApp, Radio, telephones, etc. 
3. What is the basic difference between Unicast and Multicast? 
 The basic difference between Unicast and Multicast is that in the unicast network, the message is sent from one sender to one receiver which is one-to-one communication whereas in the multicast network, the message is sent from one sender to a group of receivers. 
4. What are the advantages of broadcast networking? 
The advantages of using broadcast networking are effective network communication, proper network management, and enhanced collaboration.

Software design patterns are essential tools for developers, providing proven solutions to common problems encountered during software development. This tutorial introduces the concept of design patterns, explains their importance, and explores various types, including creational, structural, and behavioral patterns. By understanding and applying these patterns, developers can create more robust, maintainable, and scalable software systems.
What are Design Patterns?
Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems in software design. They represent best practices used by experienced object-oriented software developers. Design patterns provide a standard terminology and are specific to particular scenarios.
Key Characteristics of Design Patterns
: Patterns can be applied to different projects and problems, saving time and effort in solving similar issues.
: They provide a shared language and understanding among developers, facilitating communication and collaboration.
: By using established patterns, developers can avoid reinventing the wheel, leading to faster and more reliable development.
: Patterns are abstract solutions that can be adapted to fit various contexts and requirements.
Why Learn Design Patterns?
There are several reasons to learn design patterns:
: Design patterns help in creating code that is easier to understand, maintain, and extend. They promote best practices and provide solutions that have been tested and proven effective.
: Learning design patterns equips developers with a book of standard solutions to common problems. This enables them to quickly and effectively address similar challenges in various projects.
By applying design patterns, developers can create reusable components that can be used across multiple projects. This reduces redundancy and saves development time.
: Design patterns are derived from the collective experience of skilled developers and architects. Learning these patterns allows developers to benefit from the wisdom and insights of industry experts.
Types of Software Design Patterns 
 There are three types of Design Patterns: 
 Creational Design Pattern 
 Structural Design Pattern 
 Behavioral Design Pattern 
 Types of Creational Design Patterns: 
 1. 
 Factory Method Design Pattern 
 The Factory Method pattern is used to create objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created. This pattern is useful when you need to decouple the creation of an object from its implementation. 
 2. 
 Abstract Factory Method Design Pattern 
 Abstract Factory pattern is almost similar to Factory Pattern and is considered as another layer of abstraction over factory pattern. Abstract Factory patterns work around a super-factory which creates other factories. 
 3. 
 Singleton Method Design Pattern 
 The Singleton method or Singleton Design pattern is one of the simplest design patterns. It ensures a class only has one instance, and provides a global point of access to it. 
 4. 
 Prototype Method Design Pattern 
 Prototype allows us to hide the complexity of making new instances from the client. The concept is to copy an existing object rather than creating a new instance from scratch, something that may include costly operations. The existing object acts as a prototype and contains the state of the object. 
 5. 
 Builder Method Design Pattern 
 Builder pattern aims to “Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.” It is used to construct a complex object step by step and the final step will return the object. 
 Types of Structural Design Patterns: 
 1. 
 Adapter Method Design Pattern 
 The adapter pattern convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. Adapter lets classes work together that couldn’t otherwise because of incompatible interfaces. 
 2. 
 Bridge Method Design Pattern 
 The bridge pattern allows the Abstraction and the Implementation to be developed independently and the client code can access only the Abstraction part without being concerned about the Implementation part. 
 3. 
 Composite Method Design Pattern 
 Composite pattern is a partitioning design pattern and describes a group of objects that is treated the same way as a single instance of the same type of object. The intent of a composite is to “compose” objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. 
 4. 
 Decorator Method Design Pattern 
 It allows us to dynamically add functionality and behavior to an object without affecting the behavior of other existing objects within the same class. We use inheritance to extend the behavior of the class. This takes place at compile-time, and all the instances of that class get the extended behavior. 
 5. 
 Facade Method Design Pattern 
 Facade Method Design Pattern provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade defines a high-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use. 
 6. 
 Flyweight Method Design Pattern 
 This pattern provides ways to decrease object count thus improving application required objects structure. Flyweight pattern is used when we need to create a large number of similar objects. 
 7. 
 Proxy Method Design Pattern 
 Proxy means ‘in place of’, representing’ or ‘in place of’ or ‘on behalf of’ are literal meanings of proxy and that directly explains Proxy Design Pattern. Proxies are also called surrogates, handles, and wrappers. They are closely related in structure, but not purpose, to Adapters and Decorators. 
 Types of Behavioral Design Patterns: 
 1. 
 Chain Of Responsibility Method Design Pattern 
 Chain of responsibility pattern is used to achieve loose coupling in software design where a request from the client is passed to a chain of objects to process them. Later, the object in the chain will decide themselves who will be processing the request and whether the request is required to be sent to the next object in the chain or not. 
 2. 
 Command Method Design Pattern 
 The Command Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that turns a request into a stand-alone object, containing all the information about the request. This object can be passed around, stored, and executed at a later time 
 3. 
 Interpreter Method Design Pattern 
 Interpreter pattern is used to defines a grammatical representation for a language and provides an interpreter to deal with this grammar. 
 4. 
 Mediator Method Design Pattern 
 It enables decoupling of objects by introducing a layer in between so that the interaction between objects happen via the layer. 
 5. 
 Memento Method Design Patterns 
 It is used to restore state of an object to a previous state. As your application is progressing, you may want to save checkpoints in your application and restore back to those checkpoints later. Intent of Memento Design pattern is without violating encapsulation, capture and externalize an object’s internal state so that the object can be restored to this state later. 
 6. 
 Observer Method Design Pattern 
 It defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, so that when one object (the subject) changes its state, all its dependents (observers) are notified and updated automatically. 
 7. 
 State Method Design Pattern 
 A state design pattern is used when an Object changes its behavior based on its internal state. If we have to change the behavior of an object based on its state, we can have a state variable in the Object and use the if-else condition block to perform different actions based on the state. 
 8. 
 Strategy Method Design Pattern 
 The Strategy Design Pattern allows the behavior of an object to be selected at runtime. It is one of the Gang of Four (GoF) design patterns, which are widely used in object-oriented programming. The Strategy pattern is based on the idea of encapsulating a family of algorithms into separate classes that implement a common interface. 
 9. 
 Template Method Design Pattern 
 Template method design pattern is to define an algorithm as a skeleton of operations and leave the details to be implemented by the child classes. The overall structure and sequence of the algorithm are preserved by the parent class. 
 10. 
 Visitor Method Design Pattern 
 It is used when we have to perform an operation on a group of similar kind of Objects. With the help of visitor pattern, we can move the operational logic from the objects to another class.

 Frequently Asked Questions About Software Design Patterns 
 Software design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems that arise during software development. They are templates for solving recurring design issues and provide a way to create flexible, scalable, and maintainable software systems. 
 Design patterns promote best practices, enhance code readability, and facilitate code reuse. They help in creating software that is modular, extensible, and easier to maintain, reducing development time and efforts. 
 Design patterns focus on solving recurring design problems at the architectural or structural level, emphasizing the organization of code. Algorithms, on the other hand, are step-by-step procedures for solving specific problems at the computational level. 
 Design patterns promote loose coupling between components, making it easier to replace or extend parts of the system without affecting others. This flexibility is crucial for adapting to changing requirements. 
 Design patterns should be used when you encounter recurring problems in software design. They are particularly beneficial in complex systems where a systematic and proven approach to design is required. 
 No, design patterns are not tied to a specific programming language. They are conceptual solutions that can be implemented in various languages. However, the syntax and implementation details may vary. 
 Design patterns are proven solutions to common problems, promoting best practices. In contrast, anti-patterns are common pitfalls or bad practices that can lead to poor software design and should be avoided. 
 Yes, you can create custom design patterns based on your project’s specific needs. However, it’s crucial to ensure that the pattern addresses a recurring problem and follows the principles of good design. 
 Design patterns help eliminate code smells (indications of poor design) by providing proven solutions to common problems. Recognizing and addressing code smells is essential for creating maintainable and efficient software. 
 Yes, design patterns can be applied in microservices architecture to address common challenges such as service discovery, communication between services, and fault tolerance. Patterns like the Service Registry and Circuit Breaker are relevant. 
 Properly applied design patterns can enhance system performance by promoting efficient code organization and reducing redundancy. However, poorly chosen or overused patterns may introduce unnecessary complexity, potentially impacting performance. 
 While not mandatory, learning design patterns can significantly benefit fresehrs by providing them with proven solutions to common problems. It can expedite the learning process and contribute to writing more maintainable code. 
 Yes, many design patterns are applicable in web development. Patterns like MVC, Observer, and Singleton are commonly used to organize and structure code in both frontend and backend development. 
 Design patterns address specific design issues at a lower level, focusing on object creation, composition, and interaction. Architectural patterns, on the other hand, deal with higher-level structures of an entire application or system.

Electromagnetic Induction, often known as induction, is a process in which a conductor is placed in a certain position and the magnetic field varies or remains stationary as the conductor moves. A voltage or EMF (Electromotive Force) is created across the electrical conductor as a result of this. 
Michael Faraday was credited for the discovery of electromagnetic induction in 1831 and he also gave the Law of Induction based on the experiments he performed. Independent of this discovery Joseph Henry also discovered a similar phenomenon in 1832.
What is Electromagnetic Induction?
Assume you go cashless when shopping and your parents utilize credit cards. The card is always scanned or swiped by the shopkeeper. The shopkeeper does not photograph or touch the card. However, he swipes/scans it. How does this swiping of the card remove money? This is due to a phenomenon known as ‘Electromagnetic Induction.’
Is it possible for moving things to generate 
electric currents?
 How can you tell whether there’s a connection between electricity and magnetism? Consider what life would be like if there were no computers, phones, or electricity. Faraday’s experiments resulted in the development of generators and transformers.
The induction of an 
electromotive force 
by the passage of a conductor through a 
magnetic field 
or by a change in magnetic flux in a magnetic field is known as electromagnetic induction.
This happens when a conductor is placed in a moving magnetic field or when it moves in a fixed magnetic field.
Michael Faraday discovered this electromagnetic induction rule. He put up a leading wire similar to the diagram above, which he linked to a device that measured the voltage across the circuit. The voltage in the circuit is measured when a bar magnet passes through the device. The significance of this is that it is a method of creating electrical energy in a circuit by employing magnetic fields rather than batteries. The principle of electromagnetic induction is used by devices such as generators, transformers, and motors.
Problems on Electromagnetic Induction
Faraday law of Electromagnetic Induction
Faraday gave two laws of electromagnetic induction that are called the 
Faraday law of Electromagnetic Induction
 that are,
Faraday’s First Law of Electromagnetic Induction
Faraday’s Second Law of Electromagnetic Induction
Now let’s learn about these laws in detail.
When a conductor is put in a changing magnetic field, an induced emf is produced, and if the conductor used is a closed 
conductor 
then, an induced current flows through it.
The magnitude of the induced EMF is equal to the flux change rate.
Faraday discovered that the induced emf in the coil depends on the various factor that includes,
 The induced voltage is proportional to the number of turns/coils. The more turns there are, the more voltage is created.
 The induced voltage is affected by changes in the magnetic field. This can be accomplished by rotating the magnetic field around the conductor or by rotating the conductor inside the magnetic field.
“The amount of voltage generated in a coil is proportionate to the changing magnetic field and the number of turns of the coil.”
Lenz’s law of Electromagnetic Induction
Lenz’s Law 
states that when an emf induces according to Faraday’s law, the polarity (direction) of that induced emf opposes the cause of its creation.
According to Lenz’s law,
where,
 is the EMF produced
 is the number of tunrs of the coil
Negative Sign indicates that the induced emf opposes the cause of its production.
Faraday’s Law and Lenz’s Law of Electromagnetic Induction
Eddy Currents
Current loops induced in a conductor when placed in a changing magnetic field are called eddy currents. 
Eddy currents
 create a magnetic field that opposes the original magnetic field, which is similar to Lenz’s law. These currents are also called Foucault’s currents. Eddy currents have very useful applications such as metal detectors, electromagnetic braking, induction heating, etc.
 Breaking metal wheels on trains run on metallic tracks and when the brakes are applied, the trains’ metal wheels are exposed to a magnetic field, which induces eddy currents in the wheels. As a result of the magnetic interaction between the applied magnetic field and the eddy currents created in the wheels with friction-based braking, the trains slow down.
 The high temperature in the furnaces is prepared using the concept of eddy current.
Applications of Electromagnetic Induction
Some applications of Electromagnetic Induction are as follows:
Electromagnetic induction in AC generator
Electrical Transformers
Magnetic Flow Meter
The production of
 alternating current
 is one of the most important applications of 
electromagnetic induction.
More advanced equipment is the AC generator with a 100 MV output capacity. The effective area of the loop, when the coil spins in a magnetic field B, equals A cos 
, where 
 is the angle between A and B. 
The principle of operation of a basic ac generator is this way of creating a flux change. The axis of the rotating coil is perpendicular to the magnetic field direction. The magnetic flux across the coil changes as the coil rotates, causing an emf to induct in the coil.
An electrical 
transformer
 is another major use of electromagnetic induction. A transformer is a device that uses a magnetic field to convert ac electric power from one voltage level to another. The voltage in the primary of a step-down transformer is higher than the voltage in the secondary. 
A step-up transformer is one in which the secondary voltage has additional turns. To increase the voltage to 100 kV, power providers employ a step transformer, which decreases current and reduces power loss in transmission lines. Household circuits, on the other hand, employ step-down transformers to reduce the voltage to 120 or 240 V.
Magnetic Flow Meter
Magnetic Flow Meter or Electromagnetic Flow Meter is the device used to measure the velocity or volumetric flow of fluids and uses the principle of electromagnetic induction to do so. Magmeter (commonly used term for Magnetic Flow Meter) can only measure the flow of conductive fluids.
Electric Current
Relation between Mobility and Current
Magnetic filed due to Current Carrying Conductor
Solved Examples on Electromagnetic Induction
Number of turns, N = 50 turns
Rate of change of magnetic flux, dϕ ⁄ dt = 0.10 T ⁄ s
E = – N (dϕ ⁄ dt)
⇒ E = – 50 × 0.10 V
⇒ E = – 5 V
Hence, the emf induced in the coil is 
.
For a loop of wire, N=1, and the rate of flux increase is 0.02 Tm
2
/s i.e., dϕ ⁄ dt = 0.02 Tm
2
/s
resistance of loop of wire is 5 ohm,
According to Lenz’s Law, E = -N(dϕ ⁄ dt)
E = -1×(0.02) = 0.02 Volts
We know 
Ohm’s Law
  states, V = IR
⇒ I = V/R = 0.02/5 = 0.004 Ampere = 4 Mili Ampere
Electromagnetic Induction – FAQs
Electromagnetic Induction is the induction of an electromotive force by the motion of a conductor through a magnetic field or by a change in magnetic flux in a magnetic field.
Faraday’s law of electromagnetic induction, states that the amount of voltage generated in a coil is proportionate to the number of turns and the changing magnetic field of the coil.
According to Lenz’s law, the induced emf opposes the cause of its production,i.e., E = – N (dϕ ⁄ dt). The negative sign indicates that the induced emf opposes the cause of its production.
Various applications of electromagnetic induction are,
Electromagnetic induction in AC generator
Electrical Transformers
Magnetic Flow Meter

A computer without a program running is just an inert hunk of electronics. The first thing a computer has to do when it is turned on is to start up a special program called an operating system. The operating system’s job is to help other computer programs work by handling the messy details of controlling the computer’s hardware. 
The power supply sends electricity to the components of the computer, such as the motherboard, hard drive, and fans.
The BIOS (basic input/output system) initializes and performs a power-on self-test (POST), which checks the basic hardware components to ensure they are working properly. If any issues are detected, error messages may be displayed.
The operating system (OS), such as Windows or macOS, is loaded from the hard drive or another storage device into the computer’s RAM (random access memory).
The OS then initializes its own components and drivers and presents the login screen or desktop environment to the user.
An overview of the boot process  
The boot process is something that happens every time you turn your computer on. You don’t really see it, because it happens so fast. You press the power button and come back a few sec (or minutes if on slow storage like HDD) later and Windows 10, or Windows 11, or whatever Operating System you use is all loaded. 
The BIOS chip tells it to look in a fixed place, usually on the lowest-numbered hard disk (the boot disk) for a special program called a boot loader (under Linux the boot loader is called Grub or LILO). The boot loader is pulled into memory and started. The bootloader’s job is to start the real operating system. 
Functions of BIOS
 The Power On Self Test happens each time you turn your computer on. It sounds complicated and that’s because it kind of is. Your computer does so much when it’s turned on and this is just part of that. 
It initializes the various hardware devices. 
It is an important process to ensure that all the devices operate smoothly without any conflicts. BIOSes following ACPI create tables describing the devices in the computer. 
The POST first checks the bios and then tests the CMOS RAM. 
If there is no problem with this then POST continues to check the CPU, hardware devices such as the Video Card, and the secondary storage devices such as the Hard Drive, Floppy Drives, Zip Drive, or CD/DVD Drives. 
If some errors are found then an error message is displayed on the screen or a number of beeps are heard. 
These beeps are known as POST beep codes. 
The Master Boot Record (MBR) is a special boot sector at the beginning of the disk. The MBR contains the code that loads the rest of OS, known as bootloader. This complicated process (called the Boot Process) starts with the POST (Power On Self Test) and ends when the Bios searches for the MBR on the Hard Drive, which is generally located in the first sector, first head, first cylinder (cylinder 0, head 0, sector 1). 
A typical structure looks like this: 
The bootstrap loader is stored in the computer’s EPROM, ROM, or another non-volatile memory. When the computer is turned on or restarted, it first performs the power-on-self-test, also known as POST. If the POST is successful and no issues are found, the bootstrap loader will load the operating system for the computer into memory. The computer will then be able to quickly access, load, and run the operating system. 
init is the last step of the kernel boot sequence. It looks for the file 
 to see if there is an entry for 
. It is used to determine the initial run level of the system. A run-level is used to decide the initial state of the operating system. 
Some of the run levels are: 
 System Halt.
Single user mode.
Full multiuser mode without network.
Full multiuser mode with network.
 user definable.
Full multiuser mode with network and X display manager.
Reboot.
The above design of init is called SysV- pronounced as 
System five
. Several other implementations of init have been written now. Some of the popular implementations are systemd and upstart. Upstart is being used by ubuntu since 2006. More details of the upstart can be found 
here
. 
The next step of init is to start up various daemons that support networking and other services. X server daemon is one of the most important daemons. It manages the display, keyboard, and mouse. When X server daemon is started you see a Graphical Interface and a login screen is displayed. 
The BIOS allows the user to configure various system settings, such as:
Boot order: This determines the order in which the computer checks for bootable devices. For example, if the boot order is set to “hard drive” first, the computer will try to boot from the hard drive before checking other devices such as a CD/DVD drive or a USB drive.
Time and date: The BIOS stores the time and date information, which can be set and adjusted by the user. This information is used by the operating system and various applications.
Hardware settings: The BIOS provides options to configure various hardware settings such as CPU voltage, clock speed, and memory timings. These settings can be used to optimize system performance, but should only be changed by advanced users with the proper knowledge.
The BIOS can also provide security features such as:
Password protection: The BIOS can be set to require a password to access certain features or to prevent unauthorized booting of the computer. This can be useful in preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data.
Secure boot: Secure boot is a feature that ensures that only trusted operating system boot loaders, drivers, and firmware are loaded during the boot process. This helps to prevent malware and other unauthorized software from running on the system.
TPM (Trusted Platform Module): Some modern motherboards have a built-in TPM that provides hardware-based security features such as encryption, digital certificates, and secure key storage. This can help to protect sensitive data and prevent unauthorized access to the system.

 Web scraping, the process of extracting data from websites, has emerged as a powerful technique to gather information from the vast expanse of the internet. In this tutorial, we’ll explore various Python libraries and modules commonly used for web scraping and delve into why Python 3 is the preferred choice for this task. 
 Essential Packages and Tools for Python Web Scraping 
 The latest version of 
 Python 
 , offers a rich set of tools and libraries specifically designed for web scraping, making it easier than ever to retrieve data from the web efficiently and effectively. 
 If you’re eager to master 
 and other powerful 
 , our 
 is a great resource to enhance your skills. This course will guide you through 
 , ensuring you’re equipped to handle any web scraping project with confidence. 
 Requests Module 
 The requests library is used for making HTTP requests to a specific URL and returns the response. Python requests provide inbuilt functionalities for managing both the request and response. 
pip install requests
 Example: Making a Request 
 Python requests module has several built-in methods to make HTTP requests to specified URI using GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, or HEAD requests. A HTTP request is meant to either retrieve data from a specified URI or to push data to a server. It works as a request-response protocol between a client and a server. Here we will be using the GET request. The 
 GET method 
 is used to retrieve information from the given server using a given URI. The GET method sends the encoded user information appended to the page request. 

import
requests
# Making a GET request
r
=
requests
.
get
(
'https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-programming-language/'
)
# check status code for response received
# success code - 200
print
(
r
)
# print content of request
print
(
r
.
content
)
 For more information, refer to our 
 Python Requests Tutorial 
 . 
 BeautifulSoup Library 
 Beautiful Soup provides a few simple methods and Pythonic phrases for guiding, searching, and changing a parse tree: a toolkit for studying a document and removing what you need. It doesn’t take much code to document an application. 
 Beautiful Soup automatically converts incoming records to Unicode and outgoing forms to UTF-8. You don’t have to think about encodings unless the document doesn’t define an encoding, and Beautiful Soup can’t catch one. Then you just have to choose the original encoding. Beautiful Soup sits on top of famous Python parsers like LXML and HTML, allowing you to try different parsing strategies or trade speed for flexibility. 
pip install beautifulsoup4
 The code imports the requests library for making HTTP requests and the BeautifulSoup class from the bs4 library for parsing HTML. 
 It sends a GET request to ‘https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-programming-language/’ and stores the response in the variable r. 
 It prints the status code of the response, typically 200 for success. 
 : The HTML content of the response is parsed using BeautifulSoup and stored in the variable soup. 
 It prints the prettified version of the parsed HTML content for readability and analysis. 

import
requests
from
bs4
import
BeautifulSoup
# Making a GET request
r
=
requests
.
get
(
'https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-programming-language/'
)
# check status code for response received
# success code - 200
print
(
r
)
# Parsing the HTML
soup
=
BeautifulSoup
(
r
.
content
,
'html.parser'
)
print
(
soup
.
prettify
())
 Finding Elements by Class 
 Now, we would like to extract some useful data from the HTML content. The soup object contains all the data in the nested structure which could be programmatically extracted. The website we want to scrape contains a lot of text so now let’s scrape all those content. First, let’s inspect the webpage we want to scrape. 
 In the above image, we can see that all the content of the page is under the div with class entry-content. We will use the find class. This class will find the given tag with the given attribute. In our case, it will find all the div having class as entry-content. 
 We can see that the content of the page is under the <p> tag. Now we have to find all the p tags present in this class. We can use the 
 find_all 
 class of the BeautifulSoup. 

import
requests
from
bs4
import
BeautifulSoup
# Making a GET request
r
=
requests
.
get
(
'https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-programming-language/'
)
# Parsing the HTML
soup
=
BeautifulSoup
(
r
.
content
,
'html.parser'
)
s
=
soup
.
find
(
'div'
,
class_
=
'entry-content'
)
content
=
s
.
find_all
(
'p'
)
print
(
content
)

 Selenium 
 Selenium is a popular Python module used for automating web browsers. It allows developers to control web browsers programmatically, enabling tasks such as web scraping, automated testing, and web application interaction. Selenium supports various web browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge, making it a versatile tool for browser automation. 
 In this specific example, we’re directing the browser to the Google search page with the query parameter “geeksforgeeks”. The browser will load this page, and we can then proceed to interact with it programmatically using Selenium. This interaction could involve tasks like extracting search results, clicking on links, or scraping specific content from the page. 

# import webdriver 
from
selenium
import
webdriver
# create webdriver object 
driver
=
webdriver
.
Firefox
()
# get google.co.in 
driver
.
get
(
"https://google.co.in / search?q = geeksforgeeks"
)
 We import the webdriver module from the Selenium library. 
 We specify the path to the web driver executable. You need to download the appropriate driver for your browser and provide the path to it. In this example, we’re using the Chrome driver. 
 We create a new instance of the web browser using webdriver.Chrome() and pass the path to the Chrome driver executable as an argument. 
 We navigate to a webpage by calling the get() method on the browser object and passing the URL of the webpage. 
 We extract information from the webpage using various methods provided by Selenium. In this example, we retrieve the page title using the title attribute of the browser object. 
 Finally, we close the browser using the quit() method.

 Lxml 
 The lxml module in Python is a powerful library for processing XML and HTML documents. It provides a high-performance XML and HTML parsing capabilities along with a simple and Pythonic API. lxml is widely used in Python web scraping due to its speed, flexibility, and ease of use. 
pip install lxml
 Here’s a simple example demonstrating how to use the lxml module for Python web scraping: 
 We import the html module from lxml along with the requests module for sending HTTP requests. 
 We define the URL of the website we want to scrape. 
 We send an HTTP GET request to the website using the requests.get() function and retrieve the HTML content of the page. 
 We parse the HTML content using the html.fromstring() function from lxml, which returns an HTML element tree. 
 We use XPath expressions to extract specific elements from the HTML tree. In this case, we’re extracting the text content of all the <a> (anchor) elements on the page. 
 We iterate over the extracted link titles and print them out. 

from
lxml
import
html
import
requests
# Define the URL of the website to scrape
url
=
'https://example.com'
# Send an HTTP request to the website and retrieve the HTML content
response
=
requests
.
get
(
url
)
# Parse the HTML content using lxml
tree
=
html
.
fromstring
(
response
.
content
)
# Extract specific elements from the HTML tree using XPath
# For example, let's extract the titles of all the links on the page
link_titles
=
tree
.
xpath
(
'//a/text()'
)
# Print the extracted link titles
for
title
in
link_titles
:
print
(
title
)

 Urllib Module 
 The urllib module in Python is a built-in library that provides functions for working with URLs. It allows you to interact with web pages by fetching URLs (Uniform Resource Locators), opening and reading data from them, and performing other URL-related tasks like encoding and parsing. Urllib is a package that collects several modules for working with URLs, such as: 
 urllib.request for opening and reading. 
 urllib.parse for parsing URLs 
 urllib.error for the exceptions raised 
 urllib.robotparser for parsing robot.txt files 
 If urllib is not present in your environment, execute the below code to install it. 
pip install urllib3
 Here’s a simple example demonstrating how to use the urllib module to fetch the content of a web page: 
 We define the URL of the web page we want to fetch. 
 We use urllib.request.urlopen() function to open the URL and obtain a response object. 
 We read the content of the response object using the read() method. 
 Since the content is returned as bytes, we decode it to a string using the decode() method with ‘utf-8’ encoding. 
 Finally, we print the HTML content of the web page. 

import
urllib.request
# URL of the web page to fetch
url
=
'https://www.example.com'
try
:
# Open the URL and read its content
response
=
urllib
.
request
.
urlopen
(
url
)
# Read the content of the response
data
=
response
.
read
()
# Decode the data (if it's in bytes) to a string
html_content
=
data
.
decode
(
'utf-8'
)
# Print the HTML content of the web page
print
(
html_content
)
except
Exception
as
e
:
print
(
"Error fetching URL:"
,
e
)
 PyautoGUI 
 The pyautogui module in Python is a cross-platform GUI automation library that enables developers to control the mouse and keyboard to automate tasks. While it’s not specifically designed for web scraping, it can be used in conjunction with other web scraping libraries like Selenium to interact with web pages that require user input or simulate human actions. 
pip3 install pyautogui
 In this example, pyautogui is used to perform scrolling and take a screenshot of the search results page obtained by typing a query into the search input field and clicking the search button using Selenium. 

import
pyautogui
# moves to (519,1060) in 1 sec
pyautogui
.
moveTo
(
519
,
1060
,
duration
=
1
)
# simulates a click at the present 
# mouse position 
pyautogui
.
click
()
# moves to (1717,352) in 1 sec
pyautogui
.
moveTo
(
1717
,
352
,
duration
=
1
)
# simulates a click at the present 
# mouse position
pyautogui
.
click
()
 Schedule 
 The schedule module in Python is a simple library that allows you to schedule Python functions to run at specified intervals. It’s particularly useful in web scraping in Python when you need to regularly scrape data from a website at predefined intervals, such as hourly, daily, or weekly. 
 We import the necessary modules: schedule, time, requests, and BeautifulSoup from the bs4 package. 
 We define a function scrape_data() that performs the web scraping task. Inside this function, we send a GET request to a website (replace ‘https://example.com’ with the URL of the website you want to scrape), parse the HTML content using BeautifulSoup, extract the desired data, and print it. 
 We schedule the scrape_data() function to run every hour using schedule.every().hour.do(scrape_data). 
 We enter a main loop that continuously checks for pending scheduled tasks using schedule.run_pending() and sleeps for 1 second between iterations to prevent the loop from consuming too much CPU. 

import
schedule
import
time
def
func
():
print
(
"Geeksforgeeks"
)
schedule
.
every
(

 is a general-purpose modeling language. The main aim of UML is to define a standard way to 
 the way a system has been designed. It is quite similar to blueprints used in other fields of engineering. UML is 
 , it is rather a visual language. 
 1. What is UML? 
 Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a standardized visual modeling language used in the field of software engineering to provide a general-purpose, developmental, and intuitive way to visualize the design of a system. UML helps in specifying, visualizing, constructing, and documenting the artifacts of software systems. 
 We use UML diagrams to portray the 
 of a system. 
 UML helps software engineers, businessmen, and system architects with modeling, design, and analysis. 
 The Object Management Group (OMG) adopted Unified Modelling Language as a standard in 1997. It’s been managed by OMG ever since. 
 The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) published UML as an approved standard in 2005. UML has been revised over the years and is reviewed periodically. 
 Complex applications need collaboration and planning from multiple teams and hence require a clear and concise way to communicate amongst them. 
 Businessmen do not understand code. So UML becomes essential to communicate with non-programmers about essential requirements, functionalities, and processes of the system. 
 A lot of time is saved down the line when teams can visualize processes, user interactions, and the static structure of the system. 
 3. Different Types of UML Diagrams 
 UML is linked with object-oriented design and analysis. UML makes use of elements and forms associations between them to form diagrams. Diagrams in UML can be broadly classified as: 
 4. 
 Structural UML Diagrams 
 The most widely use UML diagram is the class diagram. It is the building block of all object oriented software systems. We use class diagrams to depict the static structure of a system by showing system’s classes, their methods and attributes. Class diagrams also help us identify relationship between different classes or objects. 
 We use composite structure diagrams to represent the internal structure of a class and its interaction points with other parts of the system. 
 A composite structure diagram represents relationship between parts and their configuration which determine how the classifier (class, a component, or a deployment node) behaves. 
 They represent internal structure of a structured classifier making the use of parts, ports, and connectors. 
 We can also model collaborations using composite structure diagrams. 
 They are similar to class diagrams except they represent individual parts in detail as compared to the entire class. 
 An Object Diagram can be referred to as a screenshot of the instances in a system and the relationship that exists between them. Since object diagrams depict behaviour when objects have been instantiated, we are able to study the behaviour of the system at a particular instant. 
 An object diagram is similar to a class diagram except it shows the instances of classes in the system. 
 We depict actual classifiers and their relationships making the use of class diagrams. 
 On the other hand, an Object Diagram represents specific instances of classes and relationships between them at a point of time. 
 Component diagrams are used to represent how the physical components in a system have been organized. We use them for modelling implementation details. 
 Component Diagrams depict the structural relationship between software system elements and help us in understanding if functional requirements have been covered by planned development. 
 Component Diagrams become essential to use when we design and build complex systems. 
 Interfaces are used by components of the system to communicate with each other. 
 Deployment Diagrams are used to represent system hardware and its software.It tells us what hardware components exist and what software components run on them. 
 We illustrate system architecture as distribution of software artifacts over distributed targets. 
 An artifact is the information that is generated by system software. 
 They are primarily used when a software is being used, distributed or deployed over multiple machines with different configurations. 
 We use Package Diagrams to depict how packages and their elements have been organized. A package diagram simply shows us the dependencies between different packages and internal composition of packages. 
 Packages help us to organise UML diagrams into meaningful groups and make the diagram easy to understand. 
 They are primarily used to organise class and use case diagrams. 
 5. 
 Behavioral UML Diagrams 
 A state diagram is used to represent the condition of the system or part of the system at finite instances of time. It’s a behavioral diagram and it represents the behavior using finite state transitions. 
 State diagrams are also referred to as 
 and 
 These terms are often used interchangeably. So simply, a state diagram is used to model the dynamic behavior of a class in response to time and changing external stimuli. 
 We use Activity Diagrams to illustrate the flow of control in a system. We can also use an activity diagram to refer to the steps involved in the execution of a use case. 
 We model sequential and concurrent activities using activity diagrams. So, we basically depict workflows visually using an activity diagram. 
 An activity diagram focuses on condition of flow and the sequence in which it happens. 
 We describe or depict what causes a particular event using an activity diagram. 
 Use Case Diagrams are used to depict the functionality of a system or a part of a system. They are widely used to illustrate the functional requirements of the system and its interaction with external agents(actors). 
 A use case is basically a diagram representing different scenarios where the system can be used. 
 A use case diagram gives us a high level view of what the system or a part of the system does without going into implementation details. 
 A sequence diagram simply depicts interaction between objects in a sequential order i.e. the order in which these interactions take place. 
 We can also use the terms event diagrams or event scenarios to refer to a sequence diagram. 
 Sequence diagrams describe how and in what order the objects in a system function. 
 These diagrams are widely used by businessmen and software developers to document and understand requirements for new and existing systems. 
 A Communication Diagram (known as Collaboration Diagram in UML 1.x) is used to show sequenced messages exchanged between objects. 
 A communication diagram focuses primarily on objects and their relationships. 
 We can represent similar information using Sequence diagrams, however communication diagrams represent objects and links in a free form. 
 Timing Diagram are a special form of Sequence diagrams which are used to depict the behavior of objects over a time frame. We use them to show time and duration constraints which govern changes in states and behavior of objects. 
 An Interaction Overview Diagram models a sequence of actions and helps us simplify complex interactions into simpler occurrences. It is a mixture of activity and sequence diagrams. 
 6. Object-Oriented Concepts Used in UML Diagrams 
 A class defines the blue print i.e. structure and functions of an object. 
 : Objects help us to decompose large systems and help us to modularize our system. Modularity helps to divide our system into understandable components so that we can build our system piece by piece. 
 Inheritance is a mechanism by which child classes inherit the properties of their parent classes. 
 Abstraction in UML refers to the process of emphasizing the essential aspects of a system or object while disregarding irrelevant details. By abstracting away unnecessary complexities, abstraction facilitates a clearer understanding and communication among stakeholders. 
 Binding data together and protecting it from the outer world is referred to as encapsulation. 
 Mechanism by which functions or entities are able to exist in different forms. 
 Software development methodologies like agile have been incorporated and scope of original UML specification has been broadened. 
 Originally UML specified 9 diagrams. UML 2.x has increased the number of diagrams from 9 to 13. The four diagrams that were added are : timing diagram, communication diagram, interaction overview diagram and composite structure diagram. UML 2.x renamed statechart diagrams to state machine diagrams. 
 UML 2.x added the ability to decompose software system into components and sub-components. 
 7. Tools for creating UML Diagrams 
 There are several tools available for creating Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams, which are commonly used in software development to visually represent system architecture, design, and implementation. Here are some popular UML diagram creating tools: 
 Lucidchart is a web-based diagramming tool that supports UML diagrams. It’s user-friendly and collaborative, allowing multiple users to work on diagrams in real-time. 
 Draw.io is a free, web-based diagramming tool that supports various diagram types, including UML. It integrates with various cloud storage services and can be used offline. 
 Visual Paradigm provides a comprehensive suite of tools for software development, including UML diagramming. It offers both online and desktop versions and supports a wide range of UML diagrams. 
 StarUML is an open-source UML modeling tool with a user-friendly interface. It supports the standard UML 2.x diagrams and allows users to customize and extend its functionality through plugins. 
 Papyrus is an open-source UML modeling tool that is part of the Eclipse Modeling Project. It provides a customizable environment for creating, editing, and visualizing UML diagrams. 
 PlantUML is a text-based tool that allows you to create UML diagrams using a simple and human-readable syntax. It’s often used in conjunction with other tools and supports a variety of diagram types. 
 8. Steps to create UML Diagrams 
 Creating Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams involves a systematic process that typically includes the following steps: 
 Determine the purpose of creating the UML diagram. Different types of UML diagrams serve various purposes, such as capturing requirements, designing system architecture, or documenting class relationships. 
 Identify the key elements (classes, objects, use cases, etc.) and their relationships that need to be represented in the diagram. This step involves understanding the structure and behavior of the system you are modeling. 
 Choose the UML diagram type that best fits your modeling needs. Common types include Class Diagrams, Use Case Diagrams, Sequence Diagrams, Activity Diagrams, and more. 
 Before using a UML modeling tool, it can be helpful to create a rough sketch on paper or a whiteboard. This can help you visualize the layout and connections between elements. 
 Select a UML modeling tool that suits your preferences and requirements. There are various tools available, both online and offline, that offer features for creating and editing UML diagrams. 
 Open the selected UML modeling tool and create a new project or diagram. Begin adding elements (e.g., classes, use cases, actors) to the diagram and connect them with appropriate relationships (e.g., associations, dependencies). 
 For each element in the diagram, specify relevant properties and attributes. This might include class attributes and methods, use case details, or any other information specific to the diagram type. 
 Enhance the clarity of your diagram by adding annotations, comments, and explanatory notes. This helps anyone reviewing the diagram to understand the design decisions and logic behind it. 
 Review the diagram for accuracy and completeness. Ensure that the relationships, constraints, and elements accurately represent the intended system or process. Validate your diagram against the requirements and make necessary adjustments. 
 Refine the diagram based on feedback and additional insights. UML diagrams are often created iteratively as the understanding of the system evolves. 
 Some UML tools allow you to generate documentation directly from your diagrams. This can include class documentation, use case descriptions, and other relevant information. 
 Remember that the specific steps may vary based on the UML diagram type and the tool you are using. 
 9. UML diagrams best practices 
 Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a powerful tool for visualizing and documenting the design of a system. To create effective and meaningful UML diagrams, it’s essential to follow best practices. Here are some UML best practices: 
 Consider your audience when creating UML diagrams. Tailor the level of detail and the choice of diagrams to match the understanding and needs of your audience, whether they are developers, architects, or stakeholders. 
 Aim for simplicity in your diagrams. Each diagram should focus on a specific aspect of the system or a particular set of relationships. Avoid clutter and unnecessary details that can distract from the main message. 
 Adopt consistent and meaningful names for classes, objects, attributes, methods, and other UML elements. Clear and well-thought-out naming conventions enhance the understandability of your diagrams. 
 Adhere to standard UML notations and symbols. Consistency in using UML conventions ensures that your diagrams are easily understood by others who are familiar with UML. 
 Clearly define and label relationships between elements. Use appropriate arrows, multiplicity notations, and association names to communicate the nature of connections between classes, objects, or use cases. 
 10. UML and Agile Development 
 Unified Modeling Language (UML) and Agile development are two different approaches to software development, and they can be effectively integrated to enhance the overall development process. Here are some key points about the relationship between UML and Agile development: 
 10.1. 
 UML diagrams provide a visual way to represent system architecture, design, and behavior. In Agile development, where communication is crucial, UML diagrams can serve as effective communication tools between team members, stakeholders, and even non-technical audiences. 
 UML use case diagrams can be used to capture and model user stories in Agile development. Use cases help in understanding the system from an end-user perspective and contribute to the creation of user stories. 
 Agile methodologies emphasize iterative development, and UML can be adapted to support this approach. UML models can be created and refined incrementally as the understanding of the system evolves during each iteration. 
 Agile modeling techniques, such as user story mapping and impact mapping, complement UML by providing lightweight ways to visualize and communicate requirements and design. These techniques align with the Agile principle of valuing working software over comprehensive documentation. 
 10.2. 
 Adopt an adaptive modeling approach where UML is used to the extent necessary for effective communication and understanding. The focus should be on delivering value through working software rather than exhaustive documentation. 
 Empower the development team to choose the right level of modeling based on the project’s needs. Team members should feel comfortable using UML as a communication tool without feeling burdened by excessive modeling requirements. 
 11. Common Challenges in UML Modeling 
 UML modeling can be perceived as time-consuming, especially in fast-paced Agile environments where rapid development is emphasized. Teams may struggle to keep up with the need for frequent updates to UML diagrams. 
 Agile principles value working software over comprehensive documentation. There’s a risk of over-documentation when using UML, as teams may spend too much time on detailed diagrams that do not directly contribute to delivering value. 
 Agile projects often face changing requirements, and UML diagrams may become quickly outdated. Keeping up with these changes and ensuring that UML models reflect the current system state can be challenging. 
 Agile emphasizes collaboration among team members, and sometimes UML diagrams are seen as artifacts that only certain team members understand. Ensuring that everyone can contribute to and benefit from UML models can be a challenge. 
 12. Benefits of Using UML Diagrams 
 UML provides a standardized way of representing system models, ensuring that developers and stakeholders can communicate using a common visual language. 
 UML diagrams serve as a powerful communication tool between stakeholders, including developers, designers, testers, and business users. They help in conveying complex ideas in a more understandable manner. 
 UML diagrams facilitate the visualization of system components, relationships, and processes. This visual representation aids in understanding and designing complex systems. 
 UML diagrams can be used as effective documentation tools. They provide a structured and organized way to document various aspects of a system, such as architecture, design, and behavior. 
 UML supports both analysis and design phases of software development. It helps in modeling the requirements of a system and then transforming them into a design that can be implemented.

CBSE Class 12 Maths Previous Year Paper 2022
Given differential equation,
(x+dy/dx)
2
 = (dy/dx)
2
 +1
on simplifying,
x
2
 + (dy/dx)
2
 + 2x(dy/dx) = (dy/dx)
2
 + 1
Subtracting (dy/dx)
2
 from both sides we get,
x
2
 + 2x(dy/dx) = 1
Now,
Order of the above Differential Equation is 1
Degree of the above Differential Equation is 2
So the sum is 1+1 = 2
Given,
= 3i-2j+2k 
 = -i-2k
By triangular law of vector,
\vec{QS} = \vec{PS} – \vec{PQ}
                 = (-i-2k) – (3i-2j+2k)
                 =(-4i+2j-4k)
|QS| = (16+4+16)
1/2
 =(36)
1/2
=6.
Similarly,
+

Consider the LHS and RHS of the given
It more or less equivalent to the commutative law,
a-2d is parallel to 2b-c where a is not equal to 2d and c is not equal to 2b,
Here, we consider the following equation so as to get the value,
Vectors when multiplied in scalar in 1 and when
multiplied using vector becomes zero
Here,
We take example,
A×A = 0
Following the procedure in the sum for same,
We get,
a x b-a x c = c x d-b x d
=> ax(b-c)=(c-b) x d
=> ax(b-c)-(c-b) x d=0
⇒ ax(b-c)-dx(b−c) = 0
(a-d)x(b-c)=0
⇒ (a-d) || (b-c)
(a-d) (b-c)+0
a.b+d.c is not equal to d.b+ a.c
Hence, the required answer is a.b+d.c is not equal to d.b+ a.c

9. The decade of 1830 had brought great economic hardship in Europe”. Support the statement with arguments. (3)
The decade of 1830 in Europe was marked by economic hardship due to various factors. Crop failures and famines led to food shortages and increased prices, causing suffering among the rural population. The industrialization process disrupted traditional livelihoods and led to urbanization, where workers faced poor working conditions and low wages in factories. Additionally, political upheaval and conflicts further destabilized the economy. These challenges combined to create widespread economic distress during the 1830s in Europe.
“The Ho Chi Minh Trail became advantageous to Vietnamese in the war against the U.S.” Supports the statement with arguments. (3)
The Ho Chi Minh Trail, a network of supply routes through Laos and Cambodia during the Vietnam War, provided significant advantages to the Vietnamese forces against the U.S. It allowed North Vietnam to transport troops, supplies, and equipment to the South, sustaining the communist insurgency. The trail’s extensive cover in dense forests made it difficult for the U.S. to target, contributing to its effectiveness. Moreover, the ability to maintain a continuous flow of resources bolstered the resilience of the Vietnamese forces, ultimately playing a crucial role in their ability to withstand U.S. military efforts.
10. What type of flag was designed during the ‘Swadeshi Movement’ in Bengal? Explain its main features.(3)
During the Swadeshi Movement in Bengal, a new flag was designed known as the “Swadeshi Flag.” This flag was characterized by its three horizontal stripes of red, green, and yellow from top to bottom. The red stripe symbolized the struggle for freedom, the green represented the fertile land of India, and the yellow represented the masses. The Swadeshi Flag became a symbol of the movement and the aspiration for self-reliance and independence from British colonial rule.

They saw Gandhi as a symbol of hope and believed that his message of non-violence and civil disobedience could bring about positive change in their lives. These workers, who faced harsh working conditions and exploitation, found inspiration in Gandhi’s call for social justice and freedom. Their understanding of Swaraj extended beyond political independence to encompass economic and social empowerment, making them active participants in the struggle for a better life.
12. Classify industries based on source of raw material. How are they different from each other? (3)
Industries can be classified based on their source of raw material into three categories:
Agro-based Industries: These industries use agricultural products as their primary raw materials. Examples include food processing, cotton textiles, and sugar mills. They rely on crops and agricultural produce.
Mineral-based Industries: These industries extract and process minerals and ores for manufacturing. Examples include iron and steel, cement, and aluminum industries. They depend on mineral resources like iron ore, limestone, and bauxite.
Forest-based Industries: These industries utilize forest products for manufacturing. Examples include paper and pulp, timber, and furniture industries. They rely on wood and other forest resources.
The key difference lies in the source of their primary raw material, with each category using specific resources from agriculture, minerals, or forests.
13.’Consumption of energy in all forms has been rising all over the country. There is an urgent need to develop a sustainable path of energy development and energy saving’. Suggest and explain any three measures to solve this burning problem. (3)

15. What is meant by regional political party? State the conditions required to be recognized as a ‘regional political party’. (3)
In India, a regional political party represents the interests of a particular region within the country. To gain recognition as a regional political party, the party must meet certain criteria, including securing at least 6% of the total votes in a state’s legislative assembly elections or winning a minimum of 2 seats in that state’s legislative assembly. This recognition allows regional parties to participate more effectively in state-level politics and advocate for the specific concerns and issues of their respective regions.
16 What are public interest pressure groups? Describe their functioning. (3)
Public interest pressure groups are organizations that work to promote and protect the broader interests and well-being of society as a whole, rather than advocating for specific narrow interests. They operate by raising awareness about important social or environmental issues, conducting research, and advocating for policies and reforms that benefit the public. These groups often engage in activities such as lobbying, public education campaigns, and advocacy to influence government decisions and public opinion in the interest of the greater good. Their primary focus is on issues of public concern, and they aim to bring about positive changes for the benefit of society.
17. Which three challenges do you feel are being faced by political parties in India? Give your opinion. (3)
Political parties in India face several challenges:
Regional Fragmentation: The diversity of India’s states and regions makes it challenging for national parties to appeal uniformly across the country. Regional parties often gain prominence, leading to a fragmented political landscape.
Corruption and Scandals: Corruption allegations and scams involving politicians erode public trust in political parties. Parties need to address this issue to maintain credibility.
Ideological Polarization: Increasing ideological polarization can hinder cooperation and consensus-building among parties, leading to legislative gridlock.
These challenges require political parties to adapt, promote transparency, and focus on inclusive governance to meet the evolving needs of Indian democracy.
18.”Deposits with the banks are beneficial to the depositors as well as to the nation”. Examine the statement. (3)
Deposits with banks offer several benefits:
For Depositors: Banks provide a safe place to store money, offer interest on deposits, and enable convenient transactions. Depositors can access funds when needed.
For the Nation: Banks use deposits to provide loans to individuals and businesses, driving economic growth. They also contribute to financial stability and fund government initiatives through the money multiplier effect.
Overall, bank deposits are essential for financial security and economic development, benefiting both depositors and the nation.
19. Why had the Indian government put barriers to foreign trade and foreign investments after independence? Analyze the reasons. (3)
The Indian government imposed barriers to foreign trade and foreign investments after independence for several reasons:
Economic Self-Reliance: India aimed to reduce dependence on foreign countries and promote self-sufficiency in various sectors.
Protecting Domestic Industries: Trade restrictions were imposed to safeguard domestic industries from competition with foreign goods.
Preserving Foreign Exchange: To conserve foreign exchange reserves, especially in the early years after independence.
Economic Planning: To implement planned economic policies, including the public sector’s dominant role.
National Security: Some restrictions were imposed for national security reasons.
These barriers aimed to promote economic development and self-reliance but also faced criticism for limiting international trade and investments.
20. “Rules and regulations are required for the protection of the consumers in the marketplace.” Justify the statement with arguments. (3)
Rules and regulations in the marketplace are essential for consumer protection for several reasons:
Quality Assurance: Regulations ensure that products meet safety and quality standards, preventing the sale of substandard or harmful goods.

Redressal Mechanism: Regulations provide consumers with avenues for complaint resolution and legal recourse in case of disputes.
Information Transparency: Regulations mandate clear labeling and disclosure of product information, helping consumers make informed choices.
Market Confidence: A regulated marketplace instills confidence in consumers, encouraging economic activity and trust in businesses.
Overall, rules and regulations create a fair, safe, and transparent marketplace that benefits consumers and businesses alike.
21.”Napoleon had destroyed democracy in France but in the administrative field he had incorporated revolutionary principles in order to make the whole system more rational and efficient.” Analyse the statement with arguments.(5)
Napoleon Bonaparte’s rule in France indeed brought about a complex blend of changes. On one hand, he dismantled the democratic institutions established during the French Revolution, concentrating power in himself as a dictator. However, in the administrative realm, Napoleon implemented several revolutionary principles. The Napoleonic Code, a comprehensive legal system, streamlined laws, enhanced uniformity, and promoted equal treatment under the law. He centralized governance, creating efficient administrative structures. Despite curtailing political freedoms, Napoleon’s administrative reforms left a lasting legacy of modernization, influencing legal systems in many countries. This dual nature of his rule exemplifies the intricate interplay of authoritarianism and rational administration.
“The peace negotiations in Geneva followed the division of Vietnam that set in motion a series of events that turned Vietnam into a battle field.” Analyse the statement with arguments. (5)
The statement highlights the critical role of the Geneva Peace Conference in shaping the trajectory of the Vietnam War. Following the division of Vietnam into North and South after the First Indochina War, the conference aimed to establish peace. However, the failure to hold nationwide elections as agreed upon deepened the divide and intensified the conflict. This failure, coupled with Cold War dynamics, led to Vietnam becoming a battleground for the superpowers. The Geneva negotiations marked a pivotal point, setting the stage for a prolonged and devastating war in Vietnam.
22. Why did Mahatma Gandhi decide to call off the Civil Disobedience Movement? Explain. (5)
Mahatma Gandhi decided to call off the Civil Disobedience Movement in 1931 for several reasons. First, he reached a pact known as the Gandhi-Irwin Pact with the British Viceroy, Lord Irwin, which led to the release of political prisoners and discussions on further reforms. Second, there was increasing repression and violence associated with the movement, and Gandhi sought to avoid bloodshed. Third, the movement had achieved some political concessions, and Gandhi believed that it was a strategic pause to reassess and continue the struggle for independence through different means, such as the Round Table Conferences.
23. Explain the importance of conservation of minerals. Highlight any three measures to conserve them. (5)
Conservation of minerals is crucial for sustainable development and preserving natural resources. Here are three key reasons for conserving minerals:
Resource Sustainability: Minerals are finite resources, and their overexploitation can deplete them, leading to scarcity for future generations.
Environmental Protection: Mining and mineral extraction can harm the environment through habitat destruction and pollution. Conservation measures help minimize these impacts.
Economic Stability: A steady supply of minerals is essential for industries and economic growth. Conservation ensures a stable supply chain.
Three measures to conserve minerals include:
Efficient Mining Practices: Implementing advanced mining techniques to reduce waste and energy consumption.
Recycling: Promoting recycling of minerals from used products to reduce the demand for new mining.
Research and Development: Investing in technologies for sustainable mineral extraction and exploration.
24.”Roadways still have an edge over railways in India.” Support the statement with arguments. (5)
“Roadways still have an edge over railways in India” due to several factors. First, India’s extensive road network reaches remote areas, making it accessible where railways can’t. Second, road transport is more flexible and versatile for door-to-door delivery. Third, road infrastructure development is faster and cost-effective compared to railways. However, railways remain essential for long-distance and bulk transportation, offering energy efficiency and reduced environmental impact. The preference between road and rail depends on factors like distance, cargo type, and infrastructure availability.
25.Describe the popular struggle of Bolivia. (5)
The popular struggle in Bolivia, known as the “Water War,” occurred in Cochabamba in the early 2000s. It was a massive protest against the privatization of water resources by foreign corporations. The people of Cochabamba, led by indigenous and social activists, organized protests, strikes, and blockades. The movement successfully pressured the government to cancel the water privatization contract and regain control of their water resources. This struggle highlighted the importance of access to essential resources and the power of grassroots movements in challenging neoliberal policies. Evo Morales, an indigenous leader, played a prominent role in this movement and later became Bolivia’s president, advocating for indigenous rights and social reforms.
26.”Political parties are a necessary condition for a democracy”. Analyse the statement with examples. (5)
Political parties are indeed a necessary condition for a democracy as they play a crucial role in representing the interests of the citizens and facilitating the functioning of democratic institutions. Examples from India illustrate this:
Representation: Political parties provide a platform for diverse groups and individuals to express their views and participate in the political process. For instance, parties like the Indian National Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party represent various ideologies and regions.
Governance: Political parties compete in elections to form governments. Without parties, it would be challenging to establish stable governments capable of making informed policy decisions.
Accountability: Parties hold elected representatives accountable to their promises and policies. Citizens can judge a party’s performance and vote accordingly in the next election.
In essence, political parties are the cornerstone of democratic governance, ensuring representation, competition, and accountability.
27. How can the formal sector loans be made beneficial for poor farmers and workers? Suggest any five measures. (5)
Formal sector loans can be made beneficial for poor farmers and workers through the following measures:
Lower Interest Rates: Banks should offer loans at affordable interest rates to make borrowing feasible for low-income individuals.
Financial Literacy Programs: Educating borrowers about loan terms and financial management can help them make informed decisions and use loans effectively.
Collateral Alternatives: Banks can accept alternative forms of collateral, such as group guarantees or assets like livestock, to expand access to credit.
Microfinance Institutions: Supporting microfinance institutions that specialize in serving the poor can provide easier access to credit.
Government Initiatives: Government schemes like interest rate subsidies or loan guarantees can make formal sector loans more accessible and beneficial for marginalized groups.
28.Describe the impact of globalisation on Indian economy with examples. (5)
Globalization has had a significant impact on the Indian economy. Here are some key points:
Economic Growth: Globalization has contributed to India’s economic growth by opening up markets for Indian goods and services worldwide. Exports of software services and textiles, for example, have surged.
Foreign Direct Investment (FDI): Increased FDI inflows have boosted sectors like telecommunications and retail. Companies like Walmart and Amazon have expanded operations in India.
Technology Transfer: Globalization has facilitated technology transfer, leading to advancements in sectors like information technology.
Job Creation: It has created job opportunities, particularly in the IT sector.
Income Inequality: However, globalization has also exacerbated income inequality, with benefits not evenly distributed.

People use their phones, tablets, or computers to spend time with their buddies. Also, individuals now evaluate others based on how technologically, whether or not they own the latest mobile phones or cars. Nowadays, listening to music on headphones is preferred over listening to another person.
Most individuals nowadays prefer the internet because that is all they have ever known. Cell phones with touch screens are all the rage these days. Technology just serves to separate people from actuality. People nowadays lack the ability to interact in real-life situations such as individual connections, problem-solving, and showing adult actions. All this is influencing our culture. Technology influences culture every time we may get anything from an internet seller rather than going to a local business. Every moment someone always sits down to watch our night on-demand enjoyment, we are shaping culture through technology.
